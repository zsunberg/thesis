  Amsabstract              = {From the text (translated from the French): "Theorem: Let $f$ be an analytic function $\ge0$ in a neighborhood of 0 in $R^n$ such that $f(0)=0$. Then there exists a neighborhood $U$ of zero such that every trajectory $y_x$ of the system $y'=-{\rm grad} \,f(y)$ satisfying $y_x(0)=x$ is defined in $[0,\infty)$, has finite length and tends to a point of $Z=\{f(x)=0\}$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$, with uniform convergence. We need the following inequality: If $F$ is an analytic function in a neighborhood of 0 in $R^n$ such that $F(0)=0$, then there exists $0<\zeta<1$ such that $|{\rm grad}\,F(x)|\ge|F(x)|^\zeta$ in a neighborhood of zero. Remark: The theorem implies that every analytic set is (locally) a retract under deformation of its neighborhood."},

  Abstract                 = {Intraspecific variation in territory size and shape can have strong effects on population structure and dynamics. The traditional theoretical approach to the study of territory size is based on optimality models that analyze decisions of focal residents as responses to the costs and benefits of defense. These models have stimulated numerous empirical studies showing that territory holders adjust their behavior according to rates of intrusion and availability of food. However, models of optimal territory size are applicable only in limited circumstances because they focus on unilateral decisions rather than on interactions. Furthermore, observational and experimental studies often find that territory sizes are insensitive to food supply. Recently, greater emphasis has been placed on two alternative approaches. The first concerns interactions among contiguous neighbors and how these affect use of space. In these models territory size and shape are determined by the balance of pressure exerted at boundaries or arise as the results of local rules of movement and interaction. The second alternative approach views territory size as the outcome of interactions between established residents and potential settlers attempting to acquire territories. By considering the simultaneous actions of multiple competitors, these models allow quantitative prediction of the effects of territory defense on population density and spatial patterns as well as responses to environmental change.},

A maximum out forest of a digraph Gamma is a spanning subgraph of Gamma that consists of disjoint diverging trees and has the maximum possible number of arcs. If a digraph contains out arborescences, then maximum out forests coincide with them. We consider Markov chains related to a weighted digraph and prove that the matrix of Cesaro limiting probabilities of such a chain coincides with the normalized matrix of maximum out forests. This provides an interpretation for the matrix of Cesasro limiting probabilities of an arbitrary stationary finite Markov chain in terms of the weight of maximum out forests. We discuss the applications of the matrix of maximum out forests and its transposition, the matrix of limiting accessibilities of a digraph, to the problems of preference aggregation, measuring the vertex proximity, and uncovering the structure of a digraph.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by applications in robotics, we formulate the problem of minimizing the total angle cost of a TSP tour for a set of points in Euclidean space, where the angle cost of a tour is the sum of the direction changes at the points. We establish the NP-hardness of both this problem and its relaxation to the cycle cover problem. We then consider the issue of designing approximation algorithms for these problems and show that both problems can be approximated to within a ratio of O(log n) in polynomial time. We also consider the problem of simultaneously approximating both the angle and the length measure for a TSP tour. In studying the resulting tradeoff, we choose to focus on the sum of the two performance ratios and provide tight bounds on the sum. Finally, we consider the extremal value of the angle measure and obtain essentially tight bounds for it. In this paper we restrict our attention to the planar setting, but all our results are easily extended to higher dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new design method of asymptotic observers for a class of nonlinear mechanical systems: Lagrangian systems with configuration (position) measurements. Our main contribution is to introduce a state (position and velocity) observer that is invariant under any changes of the configuration coordinates. The observer dynamics equations, as the Euler-Lagrange equations, are intrinsic. The design method uses the Riemannian structure defined by the kinetic energy on the configuration manifold. The local convergence is proved by showing that the Jacobian of the observer dynamics is negative definite (contraction) for a particular metric defined on the state-space, a metric derived from the kinetic energy and the observer gains. From a practical point of view, such intrinsic observers can be approximated, when the estimated configuration is close to the true one, by an explicit set of differential equations involving the Riemannian curvature tensor. These equations can be automatically generated via symbolic differentiations of the metric and potential up to order two. Numerical simulations for the ball and beam system, an example where the scalar curvature is always negative, show the effectiveness of such approximation when the measured positions are noisy or include high frequency neglected dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies fault-tolerant algorithms for the problem of gathering N au- tonomous mobile robots. A gathering algorithm, executed independently by each robot, must ensure that all robots are gathered at one point within finite time. In a failure-prone system, a gathering algorithm is required to successfully gather the nonfaulty robots, independently of the behavior of the faulty ones. Both crash and Byzantine faults are considered. It is first observed that most existing algorithms fail to operate correctly in a setting allowing crash failures. Subsequently, an algorithm tolerant against one crash-faulty robot in a system of three or more robots is presented. It is then observed that all known algorithms fail to operate correctly in a system prone to Byzantine faults, even in the presence of a single fault. Moreover, it is shown that in an asynchronous environment it is impossible to perform a successful gathering in a 3-robot system, even if at most one of them might fail in a Byzantine manner. Thus, the problem is studied in a fully synchronous system. An algorithm is provided in this model for gathering N \ge 3 robots with at most a single faulty robot, and a more general gathering algorithm is given in an N -robot system with up to f faults, where N \ge 3f +1},

Let each edge (vi,vj) be viewed as a rigid bar, of length omegaij, which can rotate freely around its end nodes. A realization of a graph G is an assignment of coordinates, in some Euclidean space, to each node of G. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining whether or not a given realization of a graph G is rigid. We show that each realization of G can be represented as a point in a compact convex set Omega subset Rm; and that a generic realization of G is rigid if and only if its corresponding point is a vertex of Omega, i.e., an extreme point with full-dimensional normal cone.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessing reachability for a dynamical system, that is deciding whether a certain state is reachable from a given initial state within a given cost threshold, is a central concept in controls, robotics, and optimization. Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10\% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a framework and the software architecture for the deployment of multiple autonomous robots in an unstructured and unknown environment with applications ranging from scouting and reconnaissance, to search and rescue and manipulation tasks. Our software framework provides the methodology and the tools that enable robots to exhibit deliberative and reactive behaviors in autonomous operation, to be reprogrammed by a human operator at run-time, and to learn and adapt to unstructured, dynamic environments and new tasks, while providing performance guarantees. We demonstrate the algorithms and software on an experimental testbed that involves a team of car-like robots using a single omnidirectional camera as a sensor without explicit use of odometry.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a distributed algorithm for converging autonomous mobile robots with limited visibility toward a single point. Each robot is an omnidirectional mobile processor that repeatedly: 1) observes the relative positions of those robots that are visible; 2) computes its new position based on the observation using the given algorithm; 3) moves to that position. The robots' visibility is limited so that two robots can see each other if and only if they are within distance V of each other and there are no other robots between them. Our algorithm is memoryless in the sense that the next position of a robot is determined entirely from the positions of the robots that it can see at that moment. The correctness of the algorithm is proved formally under an abstract model of the robot system in which: 1) each robot is represented by a point that does not obstruct the view of other robots; 2) the robots' motion is instantaneous; 3) there are no sensor and control error; 4) the issue of collision is ignored. The results of computer simulation under a more realistic model give convincing indication that the algorithm, if implemented on physical robots, will be robust against sensor and control error.},

The manipulator has three degrees of freedom in a horizontal plane, with the third joint being passive. The dynamic constraint on the free link is shown to be second-order nonholonomic. Controllability of the system is proved by constructing examples of the input trajectories from arbitrary initial states to arbitrary desired states, considering the motion of the center of percussion of the link. Trajectories for positioning are composed of simple translational and rotational trajectory segments. The trajectory segments are stabilized by nonlinear feedback control. Simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of the planned trajectory and the feedback control law.},

To help categorize this research, we have identified seven primary research topics within multirobot systems: biological inspirations, communication, architectures, localization/mapping/exploration, object transport and manipulation, motion coordination, and reconfigurable robots. This editorial examines these research areas and discusses the Special Issue papers in this context. We conclude by identifying several additional open research issues in distributed mobile robotic systems. Index Terms = Cooperative robotics, distributed robotics, multirobot systems, survey.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a general approach for the adaptive supervised learning of behaviors in a behavior-based robot. The key idea is to formalize a behavior produced by a Motor Map driven by an internal adaptive reward function. Aim of the adaptive reward function is to select the most significant sensory inputs and to use them in the best way. The greatest challenge is to keep small the search space. Motor map learning relies on the classical Kohonen algorithm, while the structure of the reward function is learnt through a non-associative reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results on a six legged biologically-inspired robot confirm the suitability of the approach. This methodology allows the human designer to easily embody all the a priori knowledge on the robot controller, while providing at the same time a high degree of adaptability and robustness against the sensory malfunctioning.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the implementation of a bio-inspired six legged robot: Gregor I. Both structure and locomotion control are inspired by biological observations in cockroaches. Robot mechanics attempts to emulate main structural features in cockroaches, like self-stabilizing posture and specializing legged function; in turn, locomotion control is based on the theory of the central pattern generator implemented on a VLSI chip. The final aim is to artificially replicate the fundamental principles that guarantee cockroach's extraordinary agility. Our major concern was on the implementation of rear legs, that seem to play a crucial role in obstacle overcoming and payload capability, and on the locomotion control, performed in this work by a cellular neural network playing the role of an artificial central pattern generator. Experimental tests showed that Gregor I is able to walk at the travel speed of 0.1 body length per second and to successfully negotiate obstacles more than 170\% of the height of its mass center.},

  Abstract                 = {A control system based on the principles used by cockroaches to climb obstacles is introduced and applied to a bio-inspired hexapod robot. Cockroaches adaptively use different strategies as functions of the ground morphology and obstacle characteristics. The control system introduced in this paper consists of two parts working in parallel. Locomotion control is performed by a cellular neural network (CNN) playing the role of an artificial central pattern generator (CPG) for the robot, while a new attitude control system has been designed. In order to reproduce the adaptative capabilities of the biological model, the attitude control system is based on a motor map and is aimed at regulating the posture of the robot to allow it to overcome obstacles. In fact, high obstacles require the locomotion gait to be reorganized by changing the posture of the robot to be more effective during the overcoming of the obstacle. Both proprioceptive and exteroceptive information are needed to solve this problem, they constitute the input of the adaptive attitude control. Simulation results illustrating the suitability of the control system are also shown.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown that a simplest walker with suitable parameter choice can walk down a gentle slope without any control forces and generate its steady walking pattern utilizing gravity effect automatically. On the floor, however, the robot cannot exhibit passive walk, so any application methods of passive walk to active walker on the horizontal floor has not been studied yet. In this paper we introduce "virtual passive dynamic walking" with virtual gravity field which acts as a driving force for the biped robot. The robot can walk on the floor without any control torque except virtual gravity effect. Since the modified gravity field seems to be very close to real condition, the generated walking pattern seems to be natural. Further, multi-pattern walking with respect to energy level is proposed. With the proposed method, safety and energy-effective control of biped walking robot can be realized. (11 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Presents a survey of the Voronoi diagram, one of the most fundamental data structures in computational geometry. It demonstrates the importance and usefulness of the Voronoi diagram in a wide variety of fields inside and outside computer science and surveys the history of its development. The paper puts particular emphasis on the unified exposition of its mathematical and algorithmic properties. Finally, the paper provides the first comprehensive bibliography on Voronoi diagrams and related structures. (284 References).},

The theory encompasses continuous-time and discrete-time systems, finite and infinite horizons, and several different measurement schemes. Also discussed are extensions of the linear theory to nonlinear systems, and derivation of the lower dimensional controllers for systems with regularly and singularly perturbed dynamics. Updated from the 1991 edition to reflect advances in the field. Suitable as a text for a second- level graduate course; assumes a basic knowledge of linear control theory. Annotation c.

  Abstract                 = {We study the stability and stabilizability properties of systems with discontinuous right hand side (with solutions intended in Filippov's sense) by means of locally Lipschitz continuous and regular Lyapunov functions. The stability result is obtained in the more general context of differential inclusions. Concerning stabilizability, we focus on systems affine with respect to the input: we give some sufficient conditions for a system to be stabilized by means of a feedback law of the Jurdjevic-Quinn type.

  Abstract                 = {The dynamical effects of imposing constraints on the relative motions of components parts in a rotating mechanical system or structure are explored. It is noted that various simplifying assumptions in modeling the dynamics of elastic beams imply strain constraints, i.e. that the structure being modeled is rigid in certain directions. In a number of cases, such assumptions predict features in both the equilibrium and dynamic behavior which are qualitatively different from what is seen if the assumptions are relaxed. It is argued that many pitfalls may be avoided by adopting so-called geometrically exact models, and examples from the recent literature are cited to demonstrate the consequences of not doing this. These remarks are brought into focus by a detailed discussion of the nonlinear, nonlocal model of a shear-free, inextensible beam attached to a rotating rigid body. Here it is shown that linearization of the equations of motion about certain relative equilibrium configurations leads to a partial differential equation. Such spatially localized models are not obtained in general, however, and this leaves open questions regarding the way in which the geometry of a complex structure influences computational requirements and the possibility of exploiting parallelism in performing simulations. A general treatment of linearization about implicit solutions to equilibrium equations is presented and it is shown that this approach avoids unintended imposition of constraints on relative motions in the models. Finally, the example of a rotating kinematic chain shows how constraining the relative motions in a rotating mechanical system may destabilize uniformly rotating states. (28 References).},

While vibrating beams, plates, and membranes as well as electrostatic comb motors have been incorporated in a wide variety of devices, connections with recent work in the nonlinear control theory of systems with oscillatory inputs have remained unexplored. We summarize recent developments in the control of mechanical systems with oscillatory inputs and pay particular attention to how these results depend on scale. For a number of applications, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian models capture the essential qualitative features of the dynamics of small-scale mechanical systems. The nonlinear response of such models to oscillatory forcing involves a nonintegrable relationship between inputs and configuration variables, and recent research has gone a long way toward characterizing this relationship in terms of the critical point structure of an energy-like function called the averaged potential. Part of the aim of the present paper is to show how the stability and bifurcation theory of the averaged potential depends on mechanism length scales. In addition to discussing scale dependence, we shall describe how to apply our theory to models which incorporate the effects of stick-slip friction at small scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Potential function approaches to robot navigation provide an elegant paradigm for expressing multiple constraints and goals in mobile robot navigation problems. As an example, a simple reactive navigation strategy can be generated by combining repulsion from obstacles with attraction to a goal. Advantages of this approach can also be extended to multirobot teams. In this paper we present a new class of potential functions for multiple robots that enables homogeneous large-scale robot teams to arrange themselves in geometric formations while navigating to a goal location through an obstacle field. The approach is inspired by the way molecules "snap" into place as they form crystals; the robots are drawn to particular "attachment sites" positioned with respect to other robots. We refer to these potential functions as "social potentials" because they are constructed with respect to other agents. Initial results, generated in simulation, illustrate the viability of the approach. (18 References).},

We assume that the actuator and sensor array forms a regular lattice, and that the underlying dynamics have a property of spatial invariance with respect to shifts in the lattice. We show how Fourier transforms over the spatial domain reduces the optimization to a family of standard, finite-dimensional problems over spatial frequency. The solutions are then obtained by parameterized families of matrix algebraic Riccati equations. Such optimal controllers have a natural decentralized and separation structure which we analyze.

  Abstract                 = {We consider mobile robots made of a single body (car-like robots) or several bodies (tractors towing several trailers sequentially hooked). These robots are known to be nonholonomic, i.e.~they are subject to non-integrable equality kinematic constraints involving the velocity. in other words, the number of controls (dimension of the admissible velocity space) is smaller than the dimension of the configuration space. In addition, the range of possible controls is usually further constrained by inequality constraints due to mechanical stops in the steering mechanism of the tractor. We first analyze the controllability of such nonholonomic multibody robots. We show that the well-known Controllability Rank Condition Theorem is applicable to these robots even when there are inequality constraints on the velocity, in addition to the equality constraints. This allows us to subsume and generalize several controllability results recently published in the Robotics literature concerning nonholonomic mobile robots, and to infer several new important results. We then describe an implemented planner inspired by these results. We give experimental results obtained with this planner that illustrate the theoretical results previously developed.},

A planner based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is considerably faster than previous path planners and it solves problems for robots with many more degrees of freedom (DOF's). The power of the planner derives both from the ``good'' properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local minima of this function. The most powerful of these techniques is a Monte-Carlo technique that escapes local minima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed representations (bitmaps) for both the robot's workspace and configuration space. We have experimented with the planner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOF's (in 2D workspace) and 6 DOF's (in 3D workspace) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOF's (in 2D and 3D workspaces). Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper uses a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to cooperatively search, an area of interest that contains regions of opportunity and regions of potential hazard. The objective of the UAV team is to visit as many opportunities as possible, while avoiding as many hazards as possible. To enable cooperation, the UAVs are constrained to stay within communication range of one another. Collision avoidance is also required. Algorithms for team-optimal and individually-optimal team-suboptimal solutions are developed and their computational complexity compared. Simulation results demonstrating the feasibility of the cooperative search algorithms are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {What is the fastest way of finding a randomly hidden target? Experimental observations reveal that the search behavior of foraging animals is generally intermittent: active search phases randomly alternate with phases of fast ballistic motion. Here, we study the efficiency of this two state search strategy by calculating analytically the mean first passage time at the target. We model the perception mechanism involved in the active search phase by a diffusive process. We show that the search strategy is optimal when the average duration of "motion phases" varies like the power either 3=5 or 2=3 of the average duration of "search phases," depending on the regime. This scaling accounts for experimental data over a wide range of species, which suggests that the kinetics of search trajectories is a determining factor optimized by foragers and that the perception activity is adequately described by a diffusion process.},

  Abstract                 = {This article discusses the problem of controlling robot manipulators with passive joints, when the number of passive joints is larger than the number of active joints. Assuming that brakes and position sensors are available at each passive joint, we investigate the following issues: (1) what is a sufficient condition for controllability of the passive joints via dynamic coupling with the active joints and how can we quantify the controllability at a given configuration; (2) what is the optimal control and locking sequence of the passive joints; and (3) how can we control both passive and active joints to an equilibrium point in joint space. We propose an optimal control method and demonstrate its validity with both simulation and experimental results. The work presented here is significant because it provides a better understanding and a guideline for utilizing manipulators with passive joints for energy efficiency and fault-tolerant design in applications such as space robotics, hyperredundant robots, and sport mechanics.

  Abstract                 = {Underactuated manipulators are robot manipulators composed of both active and passive joints in serial chain mechanisms. The study of underactuation is significant for the control of a variety of rigid body systems, such as free floating robots in space and gymnasts, whose structure include passive joints. For mechanisms with large degrees of freedom such as hyper redundant snake like robots and multi legged machines, the underactuated structure allows a more compact design, weight decrease, and energy saving. Furthermore, when one or more joints of a standard manipulator fail, it becomes an underactuated mechanism; a control technique for such a system will increase the reliability and fault tolerance of current and future robots. The article presents a robust control method for the control of underactuated manipulators subject to modeling errors and disturbances. Variable structure controllers are proposed in both joint space and Cartesian space, and a comprehensive simulation study is presented to address issues such as computation, robustness and feasibility of the methods. Experimental results demonstrate the actual applicability of the proposed methods in a real two degrees of freedom underactuated manipulator. The proposed variable structure controller provides robustness against both disturbances and parametric uncertainties, a characteristic not present on previously proposed PID based schemes.

  Abstract                 = {A 2-DOF model for quadrupedal running-in-place is presented, consisting of a rigid body on springy legs. "Energy-pumping" feedback is included to excite the natural dynamics of the system. The model exhibits at least two periodic solutions, which correspond to the bound and pronk gaits of four-legged animals. Approximate return maps are constructed around both trajectories, and these are used to derive explicit expressions for the amplitude and stability of the gaits. The pronk is shown reproduce significantly more height than the bound for the same amount of effort. However the bound has more desirable stability characteristics: simulations and analysis demonstrate that the bound is unstable if a dimensionless body inertia is greater than 1, which is an unlikely situation for either a robot or an animal. The pronk's stability, however exhibits coupling between height and inertia: a given inertia is more likely to cause instabiliry for large heights than for small heights. These results indicate that body inertia is a critical design parameter for running robots, and suggest passive mechanisms for balance and gait transition in legged robots and animals.

  Abstract                 = {Considers iterative algorithms of the form x:=f(x), executed by a parallel or distributed computing system. The authors first consider synchronous executions of such iterations and study their communication requirements, as well as issues related to processor synchronization. They also discuss the parallelization of iterations of the Gauss-Seidel type. The authors then consider asynchronous implementations whereby each processor iterates on a different component of x, at its own pace, using the most recently received (but possibly outdated) information on the remaining components of x. While certain algorithms may fail to converge when implemented asynchronously, a large number of positive convergence results is available. The authors classify asynchronous algorithms into three main categories, depending on the amount of asynchronism they can tolerate, and survey the corresponding convergence results. The authors also discuss issues related to their termination. (67 References).},

We report results on the reachable set of linear quantized systems, and on a particular but interesting class of nonlinear systems, i.e., nonholonomic chained-form systems. For such systems, we provide a complete characterization of the reachable set, and, in case the set is discrete, a computable method to completely and succinctly describe its structure. Implications and open problems in the analysis and synthesis of quantized control systems are addressed. (31 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper gives a general formulation of the theory of nonholonomic control systems on a Riemannian manifold modeled by second-order differential equations and using the unique Riemannian connection defined by the metric. The main concern is to introduce a reduction scheme, replacing some of the second-order equations by first-order equations. The authors show how constants of motion together with the nonholonomic constraints may be combined to yield such a reduction. The theory is applied to a particular class of nonholonomic control systems that may be thought of as modeling a generalized rolling ball. This class reduces to the classical example of a ball rolling without slipping on a horizontal plane.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we discuss the stabilization of the rigid body dynamics by external torques (gas jets) and internal torques (momentum wheels). Our starting point is a generalization of the stabilizing quadratic feedback law for a single external torque recently analyzed in Bloch and Marsden [Proc. 27th IEEE Conf. Dec. and Con., pp. 2238-2242 (1989b); Sys. Con. Letts., 14, 341-346 (1990)] with quadratic feedback torques for internal rotors. We show that with such torques, the equations for the rigid body with momentum wheels are {H}amiltonian with respect to a Lie-Poisson bracket structure. Further, these equations are shown to generalize the dual-spin equations analyzed by Krishnaprasad [Nonlin. Ana. Theory Methods and App., 9, 1011-1035 (1985)] and Sanchez de Alvarez [Ph.D. Diss. (1986)]. We establish stabilization with a single rotor by using the energy-Casimir method. We also show how to realize the external torque feedback equations using internal torques. Finally, extending some work of Montgomery [Am. J. Phys., 59, 394-398 (1990)], we derive a formula for the attitude drift for the rigid body-rotor system when it is perturbed away from a stable equilibrium and we indicate how to compensate for this.},

  Abstract                 = {BKMM: This work develops the geometry and dynamics of mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints and symmetry from the perspective of Lagrangian mechanics and with a view to control-theoretical applications. The basic methodology is that of geometric mechanics applied to the Lagrange-d'Alembert formulation, generalizing the use of connections and momentum maps associated with a given symmetry group to this case. We begin by formulating the mechanics of nonholonomic systems using an Ehresmann connection to model the constraints, and show how the curvature of this connection enters into Lagrange's equations. Unlike the situation with standard configuration-space constraints, the presence of symmetries in the nonholonomic case may or may not lead to conservation laws. However, the momentum map determined by the symmetry group still satisfies a useful differential equation that decouples from the group variables. This momentum equation, which plays an important role in control problems, involves parallel transport operators and is computed explicitly in coordinates. An alternative description using a ''body reference frame'' relates part of the momentum equation to the components of the Euler-Poincare equations along those symmetry directions consistent with the constraints. One of the purposes of this paper is to derive this evolution equation for the momentum and to distinguish geometrically and mechanically the cases where it is conserved and those where it is not. An example of the former is a ball or vertical disk rolling on a flat plane and an example of the latter is the snakeboard, a modified version of the skateboard which uses momentum coupling for locomotion generation. We construct a synthesis of the mechanical connection and the Ehresmann connection defining the constraints, obtaining an important new object we call the nonholonomic connection. When the nonholonomic connection is a principal connection for the given symmetry group, we show how to perform Lagrangian reduction in the presence of nonholonomic constraints, generalizing previous results which only held in special cases. Several detailed examples are given to illustrate the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a method for the stabilization of mechanical systems with symmetry based on the technique of controlled Lagrangians. The procedure involves making structured modifications to the Lagrangian for the uncontrolled system, thereby constructing the controlled Lagrangian. The Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the controlled Lagrangian describe the closed-loop system, where new terms in these equations are identified with control forces. Since the controlled system is Lagrangian by construction, energy methods can be used to find control gains that yield closed-loop stability. We use kinetic shaping to preserve symmetry and only stabilize systems module the symmetry group. The procedure is demonstrated for several underactuated balance problems, including the stabilization of an inverted planar pendulum on a cart moving on a line and an inverted spherical pendulum on a cart moving in the plane.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical framework is established for the control of nonholonomic dynamic systems, i.e., dynamic systems with nonintegrable constraints. In particular, we emphasize control properties for nonholonomic systems that have no counterpart in holonomic systems. A model for nonholonomic dynamic systems is first presented in terms of differential-algebraic equations defined on a phase space. A reduction procedure is carried out to obtain reduced-order state equations. Feedback is then used to obtain a nonlinear control system in a normal form. The assumptions guarantee that the resulting normal form equations necessarily contain a nontrival drift vector field. Conditions for smooth (C(infinity)) asymptotic stabilization to an m-dimensional equilibrium manifold are presented; we also demonstrate that a single equilibrium solution cannot be asymptotically stabilized using continuous state feedback. However, any equilibrium is shown to be strongly accessible and small time locally controllable. Finally, an approach using geometric phases is developed as a basis for the control of Caplygin dynamical systems, i.e., nonholonomic systems with certain symmetry properties which can be expressed by the fact that the constraints are cyclic in certain variables. The theoretical development is applied to physical examples of systems that we have studied in detail elsewhere: the control of a knife edge moving on a plane surface and the control of a wheel rolling without slipping on a plane surface. The results of the paper are also applied to the control of a planar multibody system using angular momentum preserving control inputs since the angular momentum may be viewed as a nonholonomic constraint which is an invariant of the motion.},

We discuss them from the point of view of computational complexity and also point out many open problems.

  Abstract                 = {Topology control, wherein nodes adjust their transmission ranges to conserve energy and reduce interference, is an important feature in wireless ad hoc networks. Contrary to most of the literature on topology control which focuses on reducing energy consumption, in this paper we tackle the topology control problem with the goal of limiting interference as much as possible, while keeping the communication graph connected with high probability. Our approach is based on the principle of maintaining the number of physical neighbors of every node equal to or slightly below a specific value k. As we will discuss in this paper, having a non-trivially bounded physical node degree allows a network topology with bounded interference to be generated. The proposed approach enforces symmetry on the resulting communication graph, thereby easing the operation of higher layer protocols. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we estimate the value of k that guarantees connectivity of the communication graph with high probability both theoretically and through simulation. We then define k-Neigh, a fully distributed, asynchronous, and localized protocol that uses distance estimation. k-Neigh guarantees logarithmically bounded physical degree at every node, is the most efficient known protocol (requiring 2n messages in total, wheren is the number of nodes in the network), and relies on simpler assumptions than existing protocols. Furthermore, we verify through simulation that the network topologies produced by k-Neigh show good performance in terms of node energy consumption and expected interference.},

Each chapter provides a state of the art, as well as a tutorial introduction to important concepts and results. The focus is on methods which are both well founded mathematically and efficient in practice. References to open source software and discussion of potential applications of the presented techniques are also included. This book can serve as a textbook on non-linear computational geometry. It will also be useful to engineers and researchers working in computational geometry or other fields, like structural biology, 3-dimensional medical imaging, CAD/CAM, robotics, and graphics.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuum percolation models in which each point of a two-dimensional Poisson point process is the centre of a disc of given (or random) radius r, have been extensively studied. In this paper, we consider the generalization in which a deterministic algorithm (given the points of the point process) places the discs on the plane, in such a way that each disc covers at least one point of the point process and that each point is covered by at least one disc. This gives a model for wireless communication networks, which was the original motivation to study this class of problems. We look at the percolation properties of this generalized model, showing that an unbounded connected component of discs does not exist, almost surely, for small values of the density ? of the Poisson point process, for any covering algorithm. In general, it turns out not to be true that unbounded connected components arise when ? is taken sufficiently high. However, we identify some large families of covering algorithms, for which such an unbounded component does arise for large values of ?. We show how a simple scaling operation can change the percolation properties of the model, leading to the almost sure existence of an unbounded connected component for large values of ?, for any covering algorithm. Finally, we show that a large class of covering algorithms, which arise in many practical applications, can get arbitrarily close to achieving a minimal density of covering discs. We also construct an algorithm that achieves this minimal density.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduces an automated guided vehicle (AGV) for guidewire-free industrial applications where rapid reconfiguration is required. The AGV, called OmniMate, has full omnidirectional motion capabilities, can correct odometry errors without external references, and offers a large 183*91 cm (72*36 in) loading deck. A patented, so-called compliant linkage avoids the excessive wheel slippage often found in other omnidirectional platforms. The paper describes the kinematic design and the control system of the platform and explains its unique odometry error correction method, called internal position error correction (IPEC). IPEC renders the OmniMate's odometry almost completely insensitive to even severe irregularities of the floor, such as bumps, cracks, or traversable objects. Dead-reckoning is enhanced further by the addition of a fibre-optics gyroscope. Because of its extraordinary dead-reckoning capabilities the OmniMate can travel over extended distances while following a pre-programmed path fully automatically. The paper describes an implemented `leadthrough' teaching system, in which an operator guides the OmniMate along a desired path, while the OmniMate records the path to memory. Later, in path execution mode, the OmniMate reproduces the path accurately, observing commanded velocities. With this system it is possible and feasible to program or modify a complete path within minutes. (13 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces error eliminating rapid ultrasonic firing (EERUF), a new method for firing multiple ultrasonic sensors in mobile robot applications. EERUF allows ultrasonic sensors to fire at rates that are five to ten times faster than those customary in conventional applications. This is possible because EERUF reduces the number of erroneous readings due to ultrasonic noise by one to two orders of magnitude. While faster firing rates improve the reliability and robustness of mobile robot obstacle avoidance and are necessary for safe travel at higher speed (e.g., Vgt; O.3 m/sec), they introduce more ultrasonic noise and increase the occurrence rate of crosstalk. However, EERUF almost eliminates crosstalk, making fast firing feasible. Furthermore, ERRUF's unique noise rejection capability allows multiple mobile robots to collaborate in the same environment, even if their ultrasonic sensors operate at the same frequencies. We have implemented and tested the EERUF method on a mobile robot and we present experimental results. With EERUF, a mobile robot was able to traverse an obstacle course of densely spaced, pencil-thin (8 mm-diameter) poles at up to 1 m/sec. (20 refs.)},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used in robotics for range measurement in obstacle detection and avoidance systems. They have also been used for localization by map matching techniques. This paper presents a novel use of ultrasonic sensors for the measurement of angular position of a mobile robot relative to a known ultrasonic source. The method is based on measurement of the phase difference of an ultrasonic wave by two receivers. The receivers are positioned on-board a mobile robot, and the phase difference therefore represents the angular position of the robot. The paper presents an experimental set up, in which the technique was tested. Experimental results show the accuracy and operational limitations of the technique.},

  Abstract                 = {We can achieve guaranteed constraint satisfaction of a hybrid dynamical system (which takes into account the underlying continuous dynamics) in a simple, hierarchical control algorithm. Two layers of functionality, (1) piece-wise viable servo controllers and (2) a ''reflex controller,'' are required for guaranteed constraint satisfaction. The resulting control structure allows higher-levels of ''intelligence'' or functionality to be added which don't have to worry about guaranteeing constraints. The structure acts as an on-line filter which approves any actions that will maintain constraints but denies any requests that would result in behavior outside that specified. In this note, we lay down the notation and theory of this hierarchy in a broad, abstract setting. Minimal properties to assure constraint satisfaction are given. The incorporation of such a model with higher planning levels and its associated convergence properties are discussed. The philosophy has been successfully applied to a robot's maintaining collision avoidance while under higher-level control, viz. path planners and teleoperation. The system operates on-line in real-time; in executing collision-free motions, the robot uses its full mechanical bandwidth.},

The continuous dynamical systems considered are ordinary differential equations (ODEs), For hybrid systems we concentrate on models that combine ODEs and discrete dynamics (e.g., finite automata). We review and compare four such models from the literature. Notions of simulation of a discrete dynamical system by a continuous one are developed. We show that hybrid systems whose equations can describe a precise binary timing pulse (exact clock) can simulate arbitrary reversible discrete dynamical systems defined on closed subsets of R''. The simulations require continuous ODEs in R(2n) with the exact clock as input. All four hybrid systems models studied here can implement exact clocks. We also prove that any discrete dynamical system in Z'' can be simulated by continuous ODEs in R(2n+1). We use this to show that smooth ODEs in R(3) can simulate arbitrary Turing machines, and hence possess the power of universal computation. We use the famous asynchronous arbiter problem to distinguish between hybrid and continuous dynamical systems. We prove that one cannot build an arbiter with devices described by a system of Lipschitz ODEs. On the other hand, all four hybrid systems models considered can implement arbiters even if their ODEs are Lipschitz.},

  Abstract                 = {Complex natural and engineered systems typically possess a hierarchical structure, characterized by continuous-variable dynamics at the lowest level and logical decision-making at the highest, Virtually all control systems today-from flight control to the factory floor-perform computer-coded checks and issue logical as well as continuous-variable control commands, The interaction of these different types of dynamics and information leads to a challenging set of ''hybrid'' control problems, We propose a very general framework that systematizes the notion of a hybrid system, combining differential equations and automata, governed by a hybrid controller that issues continuous-variable commands and makes logical decisions, We first identify the phenomena that arise in real-world hybrid systems, Then, we introduce a mathematical model of hybrid systems as interacting collections of dynamical systems, evolving on continuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous controls and discrete transitions, The model captures the identified phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure on which to pose and solve meaningful control problems, We develop a theory for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in an optimal control framework. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls and derive ''generalized quasi-variational inequalities'' that the associated value function satisfies, We summarize algorithms for solving these inequalities based on a generalized Bellman equation, impulse control, and linear programming.},

  Abstract                 = {Many control problems of interest can be cast as optimal hybrid system control problems, wherein an objective function represents some global goals and the input at each time instant is a choice among a finite set of control laws. There are many approaches to solving such problems in the literature, all based on dynamic programming in some form or another, and all suffering from overwhelming computational complexity. We attempt to lower this complexity by examining techniques that take advantage of the underlying properties of the individual controllers among which we are switching. We call this process "behavioral programming" since we are now attempting to perform dynamic programming at the more abstract level of behaviors of the constituent systems. We present our paradigm and discuss two areas of its use: motion planning for autonomous agents and LQR with state and input constraints. Applications to helicopter and wheel slip control are used to illustrate problem solving in each of these areas, respectively. (22 References).},

The most important of these come from the fact that this equation is equivalent to a certain gradient flow on the space of orthogonal matrices. We are especially interested in the role of this equation as an analog computer. For example, we show how to map the data associated with a linear programming problem into $H(0)$ and $N$ in such a way as to have $\dot H=[H,[H,N]]$ evolve to a solution of the linear programming problem. This result can be applied to find systems which solve a variety of generic combinatorial optimization problems, and it even provides an algorithm for diagonalizing symmetric matrices."},

  Abstract                 = {The author establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing and classifying actuators that generate their output by rectifying small-amplitude mechanical vibrations, such as might be generated by piezoelectric elements. These ideas are of special interest when designing for microfabrication, because motors based on these principles: can generate translational output directly without use of rotary bearings; appear to be scalable over several orders of magnitude of the length scale; and appear to be capable of generating mechanical power proportional to driving frequency over one to two orders of magnitude of frequency. In order to achieve this performance, it is necessary to be able to fabricate features, or at least control surface irregularities, on the scale v/w where v is velocity of the actuator and w is the operating frequency.

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that controlled differential equations which are analytic in the state and linear in the control have solutions which can be expanded in a Volterra series provided there is no finite escape time. The Volterra kernels are computed in terms of the power series expansion of the functions defining the differential equation. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a Volterra series to be realizable by a linear-analytic system are particularly easy to test if the Volterra series is finite; a complete theory is worked out for this instance. Applications are considered to singular control, multilinear realization theory, etc. (15 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Shows that in constructing a theory for the most elementary class of control problems defined on spheres, some results from Lie theory play a natural role. In particular to understand controllability, optimal control, and certain properties of stochastic equations. Lie theoretic ideas are needed. The framework considered here is probably the most natural departure from the usual linear system/vector space problems which have dominated the control systems literature. For this reason the results are compared with those previously available for the finite-dimensional vector space case. (17 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to study questions regarding controllability, observability, and realization theory for a particular class of systems for which the state space is a differentiable manifold which is simultaneously a group or, more generally, a coset space. It is shown that it is possible to give rather explicit expressions for the reachable set and the set of indistinguishable states in the case of autonomous systems. A type of state space isomorphism theorem is also established. These results parallel, and in part specialize to, results available for the familiar case described by dx(t)/dt=Ax(t)+Bu(t), y(t)=Cx(t). The objective is to reduce all questions about the system to questions about Lie algebras generated from the coefficient matrices entering in the description of the system and in that way arrive at conditions which are easily visualized and tested.

The layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that moves in the office areas of a laboratory, building maps of its surroundings and using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks. (14 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have witnessed great advancements in the science and technology of autonomy, robotics and networking. This paper surveys recent concepts and algorithms for dynamic vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal multi-vehicle routes to perform tasks that are generated over time by an exogenous process. We consider a rich variety of scenarios relevant for robotic applications. We begin by reviewing the basic DVR problem: demands for service arrive at random locations at random times and a vehicle travels to provide on-site service while minimizing the expected wait time of the demands. Next, we treat different multi-vehicle scenarios based on different models for demands (e.g., demands with different priority levels and impatient demands), vehicles (e.g., motion constraints, communication and sensing capabilities), and tasks. The performance criterion used in these scenarios is either the expected wait time of the demands or the fraction of demands serviced successfully. In each specific DVR scenario, we adopt a rigorous technical approach that relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization and stochastic geometry. First, we establish fundamental limits on the achievable performance, including limits on stability and quality of service. Second, we design algorithms, and provide provable guarantees on their performance with respect to the fundamental limits.},

  Abstract                 = {Beacon placement strongly affects the quality of spatial localization, a critical service for context-aware applications in wireless sensor networks; yet this aspect of localization has received little attention. Fixed beacon placement approaches such as uniform and very dense placement are not always viable and will be inadequate in very noisy environments in which sensor networks may be expected to operate (with high terrain and propagation uncertainties). We motivate the need for empirically adaptive beacon placement and outline a general approach based on exploration and instrumentation of the terrain conditions by a mobile human or robot agent. We design, evaluate and analyze three novel adaptive beacon placement algorithms using this approach for localization based on RF-proximity. In our evaluation, we find that beacon density rather than noise level has a more significant impact on beacon placement algorithms. Our beacon placement algorithms are applicable to a low (beacon) density regime of operation. Noise makes moderate density regimes more improvable},

We briefly discuss controllability issues, and then present a motion planning algorithm for stratified systems. The method does not depend upon the number of legs, nor is it based on foot placement concepts. (15 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic finite element mesh generation techniques have become commonly used tools for the analysis of complex, real-world models. All of these methods can, however, create distorted and even unusable elements. Fortunately, several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality. Smoothing (also referred to as mesh relaxation) is one such method, which repositions nodal locations, so as to minimize element distortion. In this paper, an overall mesh smoothing scheme is presented for meshes consisting of triangular, quadrilateral, or mixed triangular and quadrilateral elements. This paper describes an efficient and robust combination of constrained Laplacian smoothing together with an optimization-based smoothing algorithm. The smoothing algorithms have been implemented in * and performance times are presented along with several example models. Keywords.

  Abstract                 = {The Complexity of Robot Motion Planning makes original contributions both to robotics and to the analysis of algorithms. In this groundbreaking monograph John Canny resolves long-standing problems concerning the complexity of motion planning and, for the central problem of finding a collision free path for a jointed robot in the presence of obstacles, obtains exponential speedups over existing algorithms by applying high-powered new mathematical techniques. Canny's new algorithm for this "generalized movers' problem," the most-studied and basic robot motion planning problem, has a single exponential running time, and is polynomial for any given robot. The algorithm has an optimal running time exponent and is based on the notion of roadmaps - one-dimensional subsets of the robot's configuration space. In deriving the single exponential bound, Canny introduces and reveals the power of two tools that have not been previously used in geometric algorithms: the generalized (multivariable) resultant for a system of polynomials and Whitney's notion of stratified sets. He has also developed a novel representation of object orientation based on unnormalized quaternions which reduces the complexity of the algorithms and enhances their practical applicability. After dealing with the movers' problem, the book next attacks and derives several lower bounds on extensions of the problem: finding the shortest path among polyhedral obstacles, planning with velocity limits, and compliant motion planning with uncertainty. It introduces a clever technique, "path encoding," that allows a proof of NP-hardness for the first two problems and then shows that the general form of compliant motion planning, a problem that is the focus of a great deal of recent work in robotics, is non-deterministic exponential time hard. Canny proves this result using a highly original construction. John Canny received his doctorate from MIT And is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Division at the University of California, Berkeley. The Complexity of Robot Motion Planning is the winner of the 1987 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.},

Groups of mobile robots are constructed, with an aim to studying such issues as group architecture, resource conflict, origin of cooperation, learning, and geometric problems. As yet, few applications of cooperative robotics have been reported, and supporting theory is still in its formative stages. In this paper, we give a critical survey of existing works and discuss open problems in this field, emphasizing the various theoretical issues that arise in the study of cooperative robotics. We describe the intellectual heritages that have guided early research, as well as possible additions to the set of existing motivations.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the trajectory tracking control problem for a 4-wheel differentially driven mobile robot moving on an outdoor terrain. A dynamic model is presented accounting for the effects of wheel skidding. A model-based nonlinear controller is designed, following the dynamic feedback linearization paradigm. An operational nonholonomic constraint is added at this stage, so as to obtain a predictable behavior for the instantaneous center of rotation thus preventing excessive skidding. The controller is then robustified, using conventional linear techniques, against uncertainty in the soil parameters at the ground-wheel contact. Simulation results show the good performance in tracking spline-type trajectories on a virtual terrain with varying characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {The rendezvous problem can be seen as the simplest instance of coordinated control of autonomous agents. This problem has been widely investigated in the recent years. It is clear that the information exchange must have an important influence on the performance of the control strategy. In this contribution the information flow is modelled by a graph representing the information transmission from one vehicle to another one. In this graph there exist two kinds of edges. One kind represents the exact data transmission. This is very expensive with respect to the communication rate required. A second kind of edges represents the transmission logarithmic quantized data. On the contrary this is very cheap with respect to communication rate required. The final goal of the present paper is to determine how the degree of connection of this graph influences the performance of the coordinated control system.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the problem of multirobot deployment under temporal deadlines. The objective is to compute strategies trading off safety for speed to maximize the probability of reaching a given set of target locations within a pre-assigned temporal deadline. We formulate this problem using the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and we show that thanks to this framework it is possible to determine deploying strategies maximizing the probability of success while satisfying the deadline. Moreover, the formulation allows to exactly compute the failure probability of complex deployment tasks. Simulation results illustrate how the proposed method works in different scenarios and show how informed decisions can be made regarding the size of the robot team.},

  Abstract                 = {The author formulates and solves a class of dynamic search problems for obtaining the closed-loop sequence of measurements which, under a symmetry condition on the probability distribution of the measurements, optimally selects among many candidate hypotheses. Under this condition, the optimal strategy is characterized by a simple index rule which depends only on the ordering of the conditional probabilities of the hypotheses given the past measurements. The author proves that this index rule is optimal independent of the number of measurements to be taken. The author illustrates with numerical examples that, when the symmetry conditions are relaxed, the index policies are suboptimal, but achieve performance which is close to optimal. The results can be applied to solve complex problems in fault diagnosis and search with unreliable tests},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider the problem of task partitioning among members of a team of cooperating agents in response to discovery of new tasks or potential failures of some agents. We assume that information about new targets or agent failures is received by individual team members, and communicated asynchronously with delays to the rest of the team. These delays create potential differences in information across the team of agents. We describe an asynchronous approach to coordinating the team response, where individual agents compute modifications to assignments based on local information. We show that the asynchronous algorithms converge to the same optimal assignments in the presence of arbitrary finite communication delays as a centralized information approach. We extend the asynchronous protocol to the solution of a class of stochastic dynamic resource assignment problems, and show asynchronous convergence of the resulting algorithms. Simulations illustrate the delays in computing an optimal assignment of tasks in response to dynamic events.},

In particular, a finite integration method is developed for the computation of various order monomial integrals over polyhedral solids and surfaces in the 3-space. The integration method presented, can also be used for the exact evaluation of domain integrals of trivariate polynomial forms. (18 References).},

  Abstract                 = { The traveling salesman problem (TSP) consists of nding the length of the shortest closed tour visiting N \cities". We consider the Euclidean TSP where the cities are distributed randomly and independently in a d-dimensional unit hypercube. Working with periodic boundary conditions and inspired by a remarkable universality in the kth nearest neighbor distribution, we nd for the average optimum tour length hLEi = E(d)N1?1=d [1 + O(1=N)] with E(2) = 0:7120 0:0002 and E(3) = 0:6979 0:0002. We then derive analytical predictions for these quantities using the random link approximation, where the lengths between cities are taken as independent random variables. From the \cavity" equations developed by Krauth, M ezard and Parisi, we calculate the associated random link values RL(d). For d = 1;2;3, numerical results show that the random link approximation is a good one, with a discrepancy of less than 2.1% between E(d) and RL(d). For large d, we argue that the approximation is exact up to O(1=d2) and give a conjecture for E(d), in terms of a power series in 1=d, specifying both leading and subleading coe cients.},

  Abstract                 = {Self-stabilization is a unified model of fault tolerance. A self-stabilizing system can recover from an arbitrary transient fault without re-initialization. Self-stabilization is a particularly valuable attribute of distributed systems since they are tipically prone to various faults and dynamic changes. In several distributed applications, pairing of processors connected in a network can be viewed as a matching of the underlying graph of the network. A self-stabilizing matching algorithm can be used to build fault tolerant pairing of clients and servers connected in a network. First contribution of this report is an efficient, dynamic and self-stabilizing mazimal matching algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks. The algorithm implements a locally distinct label generation technique that can be used by other applications. The second contribution of this report is a dynamic and self-stabilizing maximum matching alrogithm for arbitrary biparite networks. This is the first distributed amximum matching algorithm for networks containing cycles.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a general search strategy called SANDROS for motion planning, and its applications to motion planning for three types of robots: (1) manipulator; (2) rigid object; and (3) multiple rigid objects. SANDROS is a dynamic-graph search algorithm, and can be described as a hierarchical, nonuniform-multiresolution, best-first search to find a heuristically short motion in the configuration space. The SANDROS planner is resolution complete, and its computation time is commensurate with the problem difficulty measured empirically by the solution-path complexity. For many realistic problems involving a manipulator or a rigid object with six degrees of freedom, its computation times are under 1 minute for easy problems involving wide free space, and several minutes for relatively hard problems.},

Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic de-mining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {The hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (HGVG) is a roadmap developed for sensor-based exploration in unknown environments. The paper defines the HGVG structure. A robot can plan a path between two locations in its work space or configuration space by simply planning a path onto the HGVG, then along the HGVG, and finally from the HGVG to the goal. Since the bulk of the path planning occurs on the one-dimensional HGVG, motion planning in arbitrary dimensioned spaces is virtually reduced to a one-dimensional search problem. The bulk of the paper is dedicated to ensuring the HGVG is sufficient for motion planning by demonstrating that the HGVG (with its links) is an arc-wise connected structure. All of the proofs in the paper that lead toward the connectivity result focus on a large subset of spaces in R/sup 3/, but wherever possible, results are derived in R/sup m/. In fact, under a strict set of conditions, the HGVG (the GVG by itself) is indeed connected, and hence sufficient for motion planning. The chief advantage of the HGVG is that it possesses an incremental construction procedure that constructs the HGVG using only line-of-sight sensor data. Once the robot constructs the HGVG, it has effectively explored the environment, because it can then use the HGVG to plan a path between two arbitrary configurations. (22 References).},

The method is a based on a sensor-based incremental construction of a one-dimensional retract of the free space. In this paper we introduce a retract termed the generalized Voronoi graph, and also analyze the roadmap of Canny and Lin's opportunistic path planner (1990, 1993). The bulk of this paper is devoted to the application of nonsmooth analysis to the Euclidean distance function. We show that the distance function is in fact nonsmooth at the points which are required to construct the plan.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a new method for improving the azimuth accuracy of range information using conventional (Polaroid) low-resolution ultrasonic sensors mounted in a circular array on a mobile robot. Although ultrasonic sensors are fairly accurate in measuring distance in depth, they commonly have significant uncertainty in azimuth. We model this uncertainty with a uniform distribution along an arc. This means that the echo has an equal likelihood of originating from any point along the arc. We then introduce a new method to fuse sonar data to better approximate the actual obstacle location. This new method is termed the arc transversal median method because the robot determines the location of an object 1) by intersecting one arc with other arcs, 2) then by considering only "transversal" intersections, those which exceed a threshold in angle, and 3) by taking the median of the intersections. The median is a robust estimator that is insensitive to noise; a few stray readings will not affect its value. We show, via some simple geometric relationships, that this method can improve the azimuth accuracy of the sonar sensor by a specified amount under well-defined conditions. Experimental results on an ultrasonic sensor array situated on a mobile robot verify this approach.},

Recall that a roadmap is a geometric structure that a robot uses to plan a path between two points in an environment. If the robot knows the roadmap, then it knows the environment. Likewise, if the robot constructs the roadmap, then it has effectively explored the environment. The paper focuses on the hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (HGVG). The incremental construction procedure of the HGVG requires only local distance sensor measurements, and therefore the method can be used as a basis for sensor-based planning algorithms. Simulations and experiments using a mobile robot with ultrasonic sensors verify this approach. (15 References).},

Our key innovation is to consider time-consistent, dynamic risk metrics as objective functions to be minimized. This framework is axiomatically justified in terms of time-consistency of risk preferences, is amenable to dynamic optimization, and is unifying in the sense that it captures a full range of risk assessments from risk-neutral to worst case. Within this framework, we propose and analyze an online risk-averse MPC algorithm that is provably stabilizing. Furthermore, by exploiting the dual representation of time-consistent, dynamic risk metrics, we cast the computation of the MPC control law as a convex optimization problem amenable to implementation on embedded systems. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a discretization algorithm for the solution of stochastic optimal control problems with dynamic, time-consistent risk constraints. Previous works have shown that such problems can be cast as Markov decision problems (MDPs) on an augmented state space where a �constrained� form of Bellman's recursion can be applied. However, even if both the state space and action spaces for the original optimization problem are finite, the augmented state in the induced MDP problem contains state variables that are continuous. Our approach is to apply a uniform-grid discretization scheme for the augmented state. To prove the correctness of this approach, we develop novel Lipschitz bounds for �constrained� dynamic programming operators. We show that convergence to the optimal value functions is linear in the step size, which is the same convergence rate for discretization algorithms for unconstrained dynamic programming operators. Simulation experiments are presented and discussed.},

Travel times and failure rates are stochastic but related, inasmuch as failure rates increase with speed. To maximize chances of success while meeting the deadline, a control strategy has therefore to balance safety and performance. Our approach is to cast the problem within the theory of constrained Markov Decision Processes, whereby we seek to compute policies that maximize the probability of successful deployment while ensuring that the expected duration of the task is bounded by a given deadline. To account for uncertainties in the problem parameters, we consider a robust formulation and we propose efficient solution algorithms, which are of independent interest.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider Markov decision processes with average cost criteria, and discuss an approach for characterizing the performance loss associated with using a suboptimal control policy. Because there are often difficulties associated with computing and implementing optimal control policies, heuristic control policies are often used in practice. For such a policy, we would like to be able to compute guaranteed bounds on its performance, specifically its performance relative to an optimal policy. In other words, our goal is to produce a systematic approach for evaluating how far a specific policy is from optimality. This approach is demonstrated on a simple queuing system with a single server and multiple job classes. We use the general methods developed in the first part of the paper to show that for any non-idling policy, suboptimality of the resulting average queue length is bounded by a factor which only involves service rates.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors have built the first 3D, kneed, two-legged passive-dynamic walking machine. Since the work of T. McGeer (1990, 1991), the concept of passive dynamics has added insight into animal locomotion and the design of anthropomorphic robots. Various analyses and machines that demonstrate efficient humanlike walking have been developed using this strategy. Human-like passive machines, however have only operated in two dimensions (i.e. within the fore-aft or sagittal plane). 3D passive walking devices, mostly toys, have not had human-like motions but instead a stiff-legged waddle. In the present 3D device, the authors preserve features of McGeer's 2D models, including mechanical simplicity, human-like knee flexure and passive gravitational power from descending a shallow slope. They then add specially curved feet, a compliant heel and mechanically constrained arms to achieve a harmonious and stable gait. The device stands 85 cm tall. It weighs 4.8 kg, walks at about 0.51 m/s down a 3.1 degrees slope and consumes 1.3 W. This robot further implicates passive dynamics in human walking and may help point the way toward simple and efficient robots with human-like motions. (17 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Groups of animals often need to make communal decisions, for example about which activities to perform, when to perform them and which direction to travel in; however, little is known about how they do so. Here, we model the fitness consequences of two possible decision-making mechanisms: 'despotism' and 'democracy'. We show that under most conditions, the costs to subordinate group members, and to the group as a whole, are considerably higher for despotic than for democratic decisions. Even when the despot is the most experienced group member, it only pays other members to accept its decision when group size is small and the difference in information is large. Democratic decisions are more beneficial primarily because they tend to produce less extreme decisions, rather than because each individual has an influence on the decision per se. Our model suggests that democracy should be widespread and makes quantitative, testable predictions about group decision-making in non-humans.},

  Abstract                 = {In the so-called direct method of solution of optimal control problems, either the state variable time history or the control variable time history, or both, of the continuous problem are discretized. The problem then becomes a parameter optimization problem. The system governing equations may be satisfied by explicit numerical integration or implicitly, by including nonlinear constraints, which are in fact quadrature rules. A method termed differential inclusion has been recommended for the solution of certain classes of such problems because it reduces the size of the parameter optimization problem. It does this by removing bounded control variables in favour of bounds on attainable time rates of change of the states. We demonstrate analytically and with several computed problem solutions that differential inclusion yields larger rather than smaller nonlinear programming problems than direct methods, which retain the control variables but use much more sophisticated implicit quadrature rules.

Because the mission involves multiple vehicles, cooperation can be used to balance the work load and to increase information gain.

  Abstract                 = {On September 28, 2003 the Italian power system experienced an electric power blackout. The outage affected an area with an estimated 60 million people and load variation in the continental grid from about 24000 MW at the early hours of the day, up to 50000 MW during the central part of the day. The event which caused the blackout began at 3:01:00 am and proceeded up to 3:28:00. Power was restored after three hours in the North area and during the same day in the large part of Italy. The energy not delivered amounts to 180GWh. The paper explains the major events that occurred as the blackout initiated and evolved and identifies the technical causes characterising the different phases of the process, which led to the general blackout. It lists the sequence of the interconnection loss and reconstructs the dynamic phases of unstable phenomena leading to the separation from Europe. The subsequent slow death throes of the separated Italian network with a cascade of generator tripping is also described up to final blackout.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers discontinuous dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose associated vector field is a discontinuous function of the state. Discontinuous dynamical systems arise in a large number of applications, including optimal control, nonsmooth mechanics, and robotic manipulation. Independently of the particular application, one always faces similar questions when dealing with discontinuous dynamical systems. The most basic one is the notion of solution. We begin by introducing the notions of Caratheodory, Filippov and sample-and-hold solutions, discuss existence and uniqueness results for them, and examine various examples. We also give specific pointers to other notions of solution defined in the literature. Once the notion of solution has been settled, we turn our attention to the analysis of stability of discontinuous systems. We introduce the concepts of generalized gradient of locally Lipschitz functions and proximal subdifferential of lower semicontinuous functions. Building on these notions, we establish monotonic properties of candidate Lyapunov functions along the solutions. These results are key in providing suitable generalizations of Lyapunov stability theorems and the LaSalle Invariance Principle. We illustrate the applicability of these results in a class of nonsmooth gradient flows.},

Taking a Bayesian perspective on the kriging interpolation technique from geostatistics, we design the "Distributed Kriged Kalman filter" for predictive inference of the random field and of its gradient. The proposed algorithm makes use of a novel distributed strategy to compute weighted least squares estimates when measurements are spatially correlated. This strategy results from the combination of the Jacobi overrelaxation method with dynamic average consensus algorithms. As an application of the proposed algorithm, we design a gradient ascent cooperative strategy and analyze its convergence properties in the absence of measurement errors via stochastic Lyapunov functions. We illustrate our results in simulation. },

  Abstract                 = {This note studies correctness and robustness properties of motion coordination algorithms with respect to link failures in the network topology. The technical approach relies on computational geometric tools such as proximity graphs, nondeterministic systems defined via set-valued maps and Lyapunov stability analysis. The manuscript provides two general results to help characterize the asymptotic behavior of spatially distributed coordination algorithms. These results are illustrated in rendezvous and flocking coordination algorithms. },

The authors study near-optimal gaits for an underwater eel-like robot, although the tools and analysis can be applied more broadly to a large family of nonlinear control systems with drift. The approximate solutions to the optimal control problem are found using a truncated basis of cyclic input functions. This generates feasible paths that approach the optimal one as the number of basis functions is increased. The authors describe an algorithm to obtain numerical solutions to this problem and present simulation results that demonstrate the types of solutions that can be achieved. Comparisons are made with experimental data using the REEL II robot platform. (57 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the Caltech Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed (MVWT), a platform for testing decentralized control methodologies for multiple vehicle coordination and formation stabilization. The testbed consists of eight mobile vehicles, an overhead vision system that provides GPS-like state information and wireless Ethernet for communications. Each vehicle rests on omni-directional casters and is powered by two high-performance ducted fans. Thus, a unique feature of our testbed is that the vehicles have second order dynamics, requiring real-time feedback algorithms to stabilize the system while performing cooperative tasks. The testbed will be used by various research groups at Caltech and elsewhere to validate theoretical advances in multi-vehicle coordination and control, networked control systems, real-time networking and high confidence distributed computation.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in communication, computation, and embedded technologies support the development of cooperative multivehicle systems. For the purposes of this article, we adopt the following definition of cooperative behavior: "Given some task specified by a designer, a multiple-robot system displays cooperative behavior if, due to some underlying mechanism, for instance, the 'mechanism of cooperation,' there is an increase in the total utility of the system." The development of cooperative multivehicle systems is motivated by the recognition that, by distributing computer power and other resources, teams of mobile agents can perform many tasks more efficiently and robustly than an individual robot. For example, teams of robots can complete tasks such as multipoint surveillance, distributed localization and mapping, and cooperative transport. To facilitate the development of cooperative control systems and mobile sensor networks, we have created a cooperative multivehicle testbed (COMET) for research and experimentation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the RoboFlag Hardware/Software Testbed. The RoboFlag game consists of two teams of 6-10 robots and 2 people, each attempting to capture the other teams ag while defending their own. Limited sensing capability, distributed processing, and limited bandwidth communications are integral parts of the system. The game can be played with real robots or with simulated robots. Some aspects of the game, such as the arbiter and the communications network, are completely simulated.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a group of individuals who must act together as a team or committee, and suppose that each individual in the group has his own subjective probability distribution for the unknown value of some parameter. A model is presented which describes how the group might reach agreement on a common subjective probability distribution for the parameter by pooling their individual opinions. The process leading to the consensus is explicitly described and the common distribution that is reached is explicitly determined. The model can also be applied to problems of reaching a consensus when the opinion of each member of the group is represented simply as a point estimate of the parameter rather than as a probability distribution.},

Our framework enables the representation and enumeration of possible control graphs and the coordination of transitions between any two formations.},

  Abstract                 = {Relative guidance for autonomous rendezvous and docking is a key technology for many current and future space missions, such as the unmanned on-orbit service. In these missions, it is normally required that the chaser spacecraft can plan a trajectory to the target rapidly, and control the chaser's attitude to align with the docking port of the target. This paper presents a recently developed bio-inspired virtual motion camouflage methodology to compute the optimal or near optimal orbit and attitude trajectories for relative guidance of rendezvous and docking missions rapidly. In this approach, the dimension of the optimization parameters and then the computational cost of the online trajectory planning can be reduced significantly. Multiple simulations are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm.},

The bounds depend on geometric quantities such as the maximum degree, diameter and covering number of associated graphs. The bounds compare well with exact answers for a variety of simple chains and seem better than bounds derived through Cheeger-like inequalities. They offer improved rates of convergence for the random walk associated to approximate computation of the permanent.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an algorithm for finding a kinematically feasible path for a nonholonomic system in the presence of obstacles. We first consider the path planning problem without obstacles by transforming it into a nonlinear least squares problem in an augmented space which is then iteratively solved. Obstacle avoidance is included as inequality constraints. Exterior penalty functions are used to convert the inequality constraints Into equality constraints. Then the same nonlinear least squares approach is applied. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach by solving some challenging problems, including a tractor-trailer and a tractor with a steerable trailer backing in a loading dock. These examples demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in the presence of obstacles and steering and jackknife angle constraints.},

Autonomous inspection, such as by a flying camera, or a virtual reality architectural walkthrough, could be guided by a solution to the above inspection problem. Visibility constraints on both maximum viewing distance and maximum angle of incidence are considered to better model real sensors. An algorithm is presented for planar workspaces which operates in two steps: selecting art gallery-style guards and connecting them to form an inspection path. Experimental results for this algorithm are discussed. Next, the algorithm is extended to three dimensions and inspection paths are shown. (15 References).},

Simulation case studies involving two different examples representative of the typical spectrum of nonlinear behavior in real chemical processes, an industrial polymerization reactor and an isothermal reactor exhibiting inverse response, are used to demonstrate the practical utility of the control scheme and to evaluate its performance.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the factors that may influence an animal's use of space is visibility, which in territorial species can determine how readily an individual can monitor its territory for conspecific intruders. We hypothesized that territorial red-capped cardinals (Paroaria gularis) would prefer locations that provided them with good views of their territories. Red-capped cardinals defend territories along lakes and rivers in the Amazon Basin, and visibility can vary widely within these territories. We defined visibility as the percentage of a territory that could be seen from a particular location. Visibility was measured by dividing each territory into 20 m segments and calculating the proportion of the territory that was visible from each segment. Cardinals did not distribute their time evenly within their territories: focal observations revealed that cardinals spent more time in the segments of their territory that afforded them the best view of their territory. This preference is unlikely to be due to differences in food availability, as the abundance of arthropod prey did not vary between high-visibility sites (peninsulas) and low-visibility sites (bays). Cardinals probably benefited from their disproportionate use of sites with high visibility because conspecific intruders were more likely to be detected from those sites.},

In this paper, a current implementation of the SAMON is presented, and a formal model based on interactive automata is described. The basic model is extended by process algebra constructs to handle mobility, evolution and learning. To allow cooperation of heterogeneous vehicles a generic behavior message-passing language is presented. (15 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We have proposed a new leg-wheel hybrid mobile robot named "Roller-Walker". Roller-Walker is a vehicle with a special foot mechanism which changes to a sole in walking mode and a passive wheel in skating mode. On rugged terrain the vehicle walks in leg mode, and on level or comparatively smooth terrain the vehicle makes,wheeled locomotion by roller-skating using the passive wheel. The characteristics of Roller-Walker are: 1) it has a hybrid function but is lightweight 2) it has the potential capability to exhibit high terrain adaptability in skating mode if the control method for roller-walking is fully investigated in the future. In this paper, the 2-leg trajectory for straight roller-walking is optimized in order to achieve the maximum constant velocity. Also a changeable ankle mechanism was integrated into the Roller-Walker system. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the validity of the concept of Roller-Walker and the results of straight roller-walk experiments are compared with those derived through simulation.

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have witnessed great advancements in the science and technology for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), e.g., in terms of autonomy, sensing, and networking capabilities. This chapter surveys algorithms on task assignment and scheduling for one or multiple UAVs in a dynamic environment, in which targets arrive at random locations at random times, and remain active until one of the UAVs flies to the target's location and performs an on-site task. The objective is to minimize some measure of the targets' activity, e.g., the average amount of time during which a target remains active. The chapter focuses on a technical approach that relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic geometry. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to provide analytical estimates of the performance of the UAV system on a given problem, thus providing insight into how performance is affected by design and environmental parameters, such as the number of UAVs and the target distribution. In addition, the approach provides provable guarantees on the system's performance with respect to an ideal optimum. To illustrate this approach, a variety of scenarios are considered, ranging from the simplest case where one UAV moves along continuous paths and has unlimited sensing capabilities, to the case where the motion of the UAV is subject to curvature constraints, and finally to the case where the UAV has a finite sensor footprint. Finally, the problem of cooperative routing algorithms for multiple UAVs is considered, within the same queueing-theoretical framework, and with a focus on control decentralization.},

This paper identifies this method as being of a general class of direct transcription methods and proceeds to investigate the relationship between the original optimal control problem and the approximating nonlinear programming problem, by comparing the optimal control necessary conditions with the optimality conditions for the discretized problem. Attention is focused on the Lagrange multipliers of the nonlinear programming problem, which are shown to be discrete approximations to the adjoint variables of the optimal control problem. Both methods are applied to fine-thrust spacecraft trajectory problems, including a low-thrust escape spiral, a three-burn rendezvous, and a low-thrust transfer to the Moon. (41 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a real-time planning scheme and its implementation for a class of dynamic systems. The planner is aimed to satisfy the state equations, the path and actuator constriants, and the given initial and terminal constraints. In order to generate trajectories in real-time, three broad steps are performed: (1) the structure of differentially flat systems is used to explicitly encapsulate the state equations into linear differential constraints in a flat space, and appropriately transform the boundary conditions; (ii) using semi-infinite optimization theory, an inner approximation of nonlinear constraints is made to replace these by a set of linear inequalities in the flat space, i.e., by a polytope; (iii) this polytopic representation of the system that satisfies the state equations and the constraints is then parameterized using basis functions and the planning problem is turned around into solution of a set of linear inequalities in the coefficient space of the basis functions. It is then demonstrated that numerically efficient algorithms can be built to solve the planning problem in real-time. The essence of the approach is demonstrated by two examples: (1) an implementation is performed on a spring-mass-damper system to demonstrate the real-time capability of evasion-pursuit; (ii) a VTOL aircraft is used to illustrate the application of this approach in simulation to nonlinear problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a real-time planning scheme and its implementation for a class of dynamic systems. The planner is aimed to satisfy the state equations, the path and actuator constriants, and the given initial and terminal constraints. In order to generate trajectories in real-time, three broad steps are performed: (1) the structure of differentially flat systems is used to explicitly encapsulate the state equations into linear differential constraints in a flat space, and appropriately transform the boundary conditions; (ii) using semi-infinite optimization theory, an inner approximation of nonlinear constraints is made to replace these by a set of linear inequalities in the flat space, i.e., by a polytope; (iii) this polytopic representation of the system that satisfies the state equations and the constraints is then parameterized using basis functions and the planning problem is turned around into solution of a set of linear inequalities in the coefficient space of the basis functions. It is then demonstrated that numerically efficient algorithms can be built to solve the planning problem in real-time. The essence of the approach is demonstrated by two examples: (1) an implementation is performed on a spring-mass-damper system to demonstrate the real-time capability of evasion-pursuit; (ii) a VTOL aircraft is used to illustrate the application of this approach in simulation to nonlinear problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents the theoretical motivation, implementation approach, and example validation results for a computationally efficient plume simulation model, designed to replicate both the short-term time signature and long-term exposure statistics of a chemical plume evolving in a turbulent flow. Within the resulting plume, the odor concentration is intermittent with rapidly changing spatial gradient. The model includes a wind field defined over the region of interest that is continuous, but which varies with location and time in both magnitude and direction. The plume shape takes a time varying sinuous form that is determined by the integrated effect of the wind field. Simulated and field data are compared. The motivation for the development of such a simulation model was the desire to evaluate various strategies for tracing odor plumes to their source, under identical conditions. The performance of such strategies depends in part on the instantaneous response of target receptors; therefore, the sequence of events is of considerable consequence and individual exemplar plume realizations are required. Due to the high number of required simulations, computational efficiency was critically important.},

Tools from algebraic graph theory prove useful in modeling the communication network and relating its topology to formation stability. We prove a Nyquist criterion that uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the effect of the communication topology on formation stability. We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.},

  Abstract                 = {A technique used to develop a real-time guidance scheme for the Advanced Launch System is presented. Our approach is to construct an optimal guidance law based upon an asymptotic expansion associated with small physical parameters, epsilon. The problem is to maximize the payload into orbit subject to the equations of motion of a rocket over a nonrotating spherical Earth. The dynamics of this problem can be separated into primary effects due to thrust and gravitational forces and perturbation effects that include the aerodynamic forces and the remaining inertial forces. An analytic solution to the reduced-order problem represented by the primary dynamics is possible. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman or dynamic programming equation is expanded in an asymptotic series where the zero-order term (epsilon = 0) can be obtained in closed form. The neglected perturbation terms are included in the higher order terms of the expansion, which are determined from the solution of first-order linear partial differential equations requiring only integrations that are quadratures. Improvement to the vacuum zero-order trajectory is achieved by approximating the aerodynamic perturbation effect as functions of the independent variable over subarc intervals. The results of the expansion method are presented and compared to a numerical optimization scheme and to an expansion of the Euler-Lagrange first-order optimality conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this note, we introduce the framework of partial difference equations (PdEs) over graphs for analyzing the behavior of multi-agent systems equipped with decentralized control schemes. Both leaderless and leader-follower models are considered. PdEs mimic partial differential equations (PDEs) on graphs and can be studied by introducing concepts of functional analysis strongly inspired to the corresponding ones arising in PDEs theory. We generalize different models proposed in the literature by introducing errors in the agent dynamics and analyze agent coordination through the joint use of PdEs and automatic control tools. Moreover, for the simplest control schemes, we show that the resulting PdEs enjoy properties that are similar to those of well-known PDEs like the heat equation, thus allowing to exploit physical-based reasoning for conjecturing formation properties.},

Their physical properties are subsumed by a linearizing output and they can be regarded as providing another nonlinear extension of Kalman's controllability. The distance to flatness is measured by a non-negative integer, the defect. We utilize differential algebra where flatness and defect are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat. We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with n trailers, the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from nonlinear physics. A high frequency control strategy is proposed such that the averaged systems become flat. (64 References).},

The noncommutative variables give birth to a symbolic calculus which generalizes in a nonlinear setting many features of the Laplace and Fourier transforms and which is developed in order to simplify some computations, like the so-called association of variables, related to high-order transfer functions.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonlinear control law for an underactuated ship is derived by using a nonlinear ship model which includes the hydrodynamic effects due to time-varying speed and wave frequency. The nonlinear ship model does not have the structural properties of symmetric inertia and positive damping at high speed, which have been a common assumption when designing nonlinear ship tracking control systems. Backstepping control designs are used to circumvent the problem of a non-symmetrical inertia matrix. We consider a ship with one propeller and one bow thruster. This is actually an underactuated system since only two actuators are used to control three degrees of freedom. The application of speed and wave dependent models for ship control is a first step towards the design of a new generation of nonlinear ship control systems that can operate under time-varying speed and wave frequency conditions. Previous work has often relied on the assumption of constant speed, and practical solutions have been based on switching between different control schemes at different speeds. Compensation of slowly-varying environmental disturbances, such as ocean currents, 2nd-order wave drift and wind forces are done by using adaptive backstepping. For tracking applications, global convergence is proven by using Barbalat's lemma. Computer simulations illustrate the performance of the control law.},

  Abstract                 = {The theoretical foundation of nonlinear backstepping designs is presented in a tutorial setting. This includes a brief review of integral backstepping, extensions to SISO and MIMO systems in strict feedback form and physical motivated case studies. Parallels and differences to feedback linearization where it is shown how so-called "good nonlinearities" can be exploited in the design are also made. Nonlinear, optimal and robust backstepping are discussed where parallels to linear quadratic optimal control and H/sub infinity /-control are drawn. In addition, inverse optimality is discussed as a nonlinear design tool. Physics is put into control by using mechanical systems like mass-damper-springs and ship models in the case studies. Lyapunov theory is used to prove convergence and stability for all control laws where energy dissipation is obtained by exploiting physical model properties. (39 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamic environment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle is required to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimed at using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic and dynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential for implementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds upon these efforts by proposing a randomized path planning architecture for dynamical systems in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles. This architecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion, and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling between low-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithm retains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. System safety is also addressed in the face of finite computation times by analyzing the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboard computation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed in real time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whose dynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or by higher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving a ground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented and discussed.},

A possible approach to reduce the computational complexity of the motion planning problem for a nonlinear, high dimensional system, is based on a quantization of the system dynamics, leading to a control architecture based on a hybrid automaton, the states of which represent feasible trajectory primitives for the vehicle. This paper focuses on the feasibility of this approach, in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties in the plant and/or in the environment: the structure of a Robust Hybrid Automaton is defined and its properties are analyzed. In particular, we address the issues of well-posedness, consistency and reachability. For the case of autonomous vehicles, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee reachability of the automaton.},

In order to reduce the computational requirements of the control problem to be solved to achieve aggressive trajectories, a hybrid system framework is used, which allows for a substantial reduction in the complexity of the system, as well as for guarantees on the stability of the overall behavior. The hybrid controller is based on an automaton whose states represent feasible trajectory primitives. The selection of manoeuvres, and hence the generation of the complete trajectory, can be cast as an optimal control problem that can be solved efficiently in real time. (21 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Aircraft conflict detection and resolution is currently attracting the interest of many air transportation service providers and is concerned with the following question: Given a set of airborne aircraft and their intended trajectories, what control strategy should be followed by the pilots and the air traffic service provider to prevent the aircraft from coming too close to each other? This paper addresses this problem by presenting a resolution methodology whereby each aircraft proposes its desired heading while a centralized air traffic control authority resolves any conflict arising between aircraft, while minimizing the deviation between desired and conflict-free heading for each aircraft. The resolution methodology relies on a combination of convex programming and randomized searches: It is shown that a version of the planar, multiaircraft conflict resolution problem, accounting for all possible crossing patterns among aircraft, might be recast as a nonconvex, quadratically constrained quadratic program. For this type of problem, there exist efficient numerical relaxations, based on semidefinite programming, that provide lower bounds on the best achievable objective. These relaxations also lead to a random search technique to compute feasible, locally optimal, and conflict-free strategies. This approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Multi-vehicle routing problems in systems and control theory are concerned with the design of control policies to coordinate several vehicles moving in a metric space, in order to complete spatially localized, exogenously generated tasks, in an efficient way. Control policies depend on several factors, including the definition of the tasks, of the task generation process, of the vehicle dynamics and constraints, of the information available to the vehicles, and of the performance objective. Ensuring the stability of the system, i.e., the uniform boundedness of the number of outstanding tasks, is a primary concern. Typical performance objectives include measures of quality of service, such as, e.g., the average or worst-case time a task spends in the system before being completed, or the percentage of tasks that are completed before certain deadlines. The scalability of the control policies to large groups of vehicles often drives the choice of the information structure, requiring distributed computation},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces the canonical transformation for the generalized Hamiltonian systems, which preserves the generalized Hamiltonian structure of the original system and is expected to provide new insights and useful tools for analysis and synthesis of such systems. First, the class of such transformations and some of their properties are clarified. Second, we show how to stabilize the generalized Hamiltonian systems by using the transformation. This method works even when we can not stabilize them by conventional unity feedback without canonical transformation. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed stabilization method includes the well-known one which exploits the virtual potential energy as a special case.},

  Abstract                 = {Addresses the performance limits and dynamic behaviour of the 2D passive-dynamic bipedal walking mechanisms of T. McGeer (1990, 1992, 1993). The results highlight the role of heel-strike in determining the mechanical efficiency of gait and point to ways of improving that efficiency. We analyse several kneed and straight-legged walker designs, with both round feet and point feet. We present some necessary conditions on the walker mass distribution to achieve perfectly efficient (zero-slope-capable) walking for both kneed and straight-legged models. Our numerical investigations indicate that such walkers have two distinct gaits at arbitrarily small ground slopes, of which the longer-step gait is stable at small slopes. Energy dissipation can be dominated by a term proportional to (speed)/sup 2/ from the tangential foot velocity at heel-strike and from knee-strike, or by a term proportional to (speed)/sup 4/ from normal foot collisions at heel-strike, depending on the gait, ground slope and walker design. For all zero-slope-capable straight-legged walkers, the long-step gaits have negligible tangential foot velocity at heel-strike and are hence especially fast at low power. Some apparently chaotic walking motions are numerically demonstrated for a kneed walker. (30 References).},

How can we achieve cooperation in systems composed of failure-prone autonomous robots operating in noisy, dynamic environments? We present a method of dynamic task allocation for groups of such robots. We implemented and tested an auction-based task allocation system which we call MURDOCH, built upon a principled, resource centric, publish/subscribe communication model. A variant of the Contract Net Protocol, MURDOCH produces a distributed approximation to a global optimum of resource usage. We validated MURDOCH in two very different domains: a tightly coupled multirobot physical manipulation task and a loosely coupled multirobot experiment in long-term autonomy. The primary contribution of the paper is to show empirically that distributed negotiation mechanisms such as MURDOCH are viable and effective for coordinating physical multirobot systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite more than a decade of experimental work in multi-robot systems, important theoretical aspects of multi-robot coordination mechanisms have, to date, been largely untreated. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). Most work on MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many coordination architectures having been proposed and validated in a proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed.With the goal of bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the synthesis of new approaches ---- KEYWORDS: task allocation, multi-robot systems, coordination, utility},

In particular, we analyze the problem of forming a certain pattern and following a designated vehicle, referred to as the leader, while maintaining the pattern:the flocking problem. We provide an algorithm to solve the flocking problem, together with theoretical considerations on its correctness and applicability, and numerical simulation showing the actual behavior of the algorithm. We also propose two variants of the algorithm sporting a more stable convergence, and analyze how different conditions on the equipment available to the vehicles and on the amount of knowledge they share a3ect the kind of patterns that can be formed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we first review results of integral manifolds of singularly perturbed non-linear differential equations. We then outline the basic elements of the integral manifold method in the context of control system design, namely, the existence of an integral manifold, its attractivity, and stability of the equilibrium while the dynamics are restricted to the manifold, Toward this end, we use the composite Lyapunov method and propose a new exponential stability result which gives, as a by-product, an explicit range of the small parameter for which exponential stability is guaranteed. The results are applied to the control problem of multibody systems with rigid links acid flexible joints in which the inverse of joint stiffness plays the role of the small parameter. The proposed controller is a composite control law that consists of a fast component, as well as a slow component that was designed based on the integral manifold approach. We show that the proposed composite controller has the following properties: (i) it enables the exact characterization and computation of an integral manifold, (ii) it makes the manifold exponentially attractive, and (iii) it forces the dynamics of the reduced flexible system on the integral manifold to coincide with the dynamics of the corresponding rigid system (i.e. the one obtained by making stiffness very large) implying that any control law that stabilizes the rigid system would stabilize the dynamics of the flexible system on the manifold. We finally present a detailed stability analysis and give an explicit range of the joint stiffness, in terms of system parameters and controller gains, for which the established exponential stability is guaranteed.

  Abstract                 = {Today, with air traffic rates in the United States growing by 5\% annually, and those across the Pacific Rim by more than 15\% annually, the problem which poses the greatest challenge to air transportation in the United States and abroad is the design of a safe and efficient method to automate air traffic control. This paper presents an overview of two methods for conflict-free planning in air traffic control. The first is a kinematic planner based on potential fields for which we prove kinematic safety for two- and three-aircraft maneuvers. The second is a real-time hybrid systems implementation of multiple aircraft conflict resolution. We conclude with a comparison of the two methods with emphasis on computational effort and complexity of analysis. (12 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a cooperative surveillance problem for a group of autonomous air vehicles (AAVs) that periodically receives information on suspected locations of targets from a satellite and then must cooperate to decide which AAV should search for each target. This cooperation must be performed in spite of imperfect inter-vehicle communications, less than full communication connectivity between vehicles, uncertainty in target locations, and imperfect vehicle search sensors. We represent the state of the search progress with a " map," use an invariant set to model the set of states where there is no useful information on target locations. We show that the invariant set is exponentially stable for a class of cooperative surveillance strategies. Next, we show via simulations the impact of imperfect communications, imperfect vehicle search sensors, uncertainty in search locations, and pop-up suspected locations on performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The response of nonlinear differential systems by functional expansions is dealt with. An abstract theory of variational expansions, similar to that of Graves (1927), is developed. It leads directly to concrete expressions (multilinear integral operators) for the functionals of the expansions and sets conditions on the differential systems which insure that the expansions give reasonable approximations of the response. Similarly, it is shown that the theory of analytic functions in Banach spaces leads directly to conditions which imply uniform convergence of functional series. The main results on differential systems are summarized in a set of theorems, some of which overlap and extend the recent results of Brockett on Volterra series representations for the response of linear analytic differential systems. Other theorems apply to more general nonlinear differential systems. They provide a rigorous foundation for a large body of previous research on Volterra series expansions. The multilinear integral operators are obtained from systems of differential equations which characterize exactly the variations. These equations are of much lower order than those obtained by the technique of Carleman. A nonlinear feedback system serves as an example of an application of the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Discrete-time, linear control systems with specified pointwise-in-time constraints, such as those imposed by actuator saturation, are considered. The constraints are enforced by the addition of a nonlinear 'reference governor' that attenuates, when necessary, the input commands, Because the constraints are satisfied, the control system remains linear and undesirable response effects such as instability due to saturation are avoided. The nonlinear action of the reference governor is defined in terms of a finitely determined maximal output admissible set and can be implemented on-line for systems of moderately high order. The main result is global in nature: if the input command converges to a statically admissible input and the initial state of the system belongs to the maximal output admissible set, the eventual action of the reference governor is a unit delay.},

  Abstract                 = {The design of a feedforward compensator for robust H/sub infinity / or H/sub 2/ performance under structured uncertainty is considered. For linear time-invariant uncertainty, a convex method based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) across the frequency variable is given. For nonlinear or time-varying perturbations and H/sub infinity / performance, the design problem is reduced exactly to a state-space LMI, and extensions to H/sub 2/ performance are discussed. An example illustrates the application of these techniques to two-degree-of-freedom control design. (18 References).},

A solution to the inverse kinematics is a vector of joint configuration coordinates that corresponds to a set of task space coordinates. For a class of robots closed form solutions always exist, but constraints on joint displacements cannot be systematically incorporated in the process of obtaining a solution. An iterative solution is presented that is suitable for any class of robots having rotary or prismatic joints, with any arbitrary number of degrees of freedom, including both standard and kinematically redundant robots. The solution can be obtained subject to specified constraints and based on certain performance criteria. The solution is based on a new rapidly convergent constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm which uses a modified Newton-Raphson technique for solving a system nonlinear equations. The algorithm is illustrated using as an example a kinematically redundant robot.},

  Abstract                 = {For a large class of relay feedback systems (RFS) there will be limit cycle oscillations. Conditions to check existence and local stability of limit cycles for these systems are well known. Global stability conditions, however, are practically nonexistent. The paper presents conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that, when satisfied, guarantee global asymptotic stability of limit cycles induced by relays with hysteresis in feedback with linear time-invariant (LTI) stable systems. The analysis consists in finding quadratic surface Lyapunov functions for Poincare maps associated with RFS. These results are based on the discovery that a typical Poincare map induced by an LTI flow between two hyperplanes can be represented as a linear transformation analytically parametrized by a scalar function of the state. Moreover, level sets of this function are convex subsets of linear manifolds. The search for quadratic Lyapunov functions on switching surfaces is done by solving a set of LMIs. Although this analysis methodology yields only a sufficient criterion of stability, it has proved very successful in globally analyzing a large number of examples with a unique locally stable symmetric unimodal limit cycle. In fact, it is still an open problem whether there exists an example with a globally stable symmetric unimodal limit cycle that could not be successfully analyzed with this new methodology. Examples analyzed include minimum-phase systems, systems of relative degree larger than one, and of high dimension. Such results lead us to believe that globally stable limit cycles of RFS frequently have quadratic surface Lyapunov functions. (25 References).},

This problem requires repeatedly answering the following question while the model is being built: Where should the robot go to perform the next sensing operation? A next-best-view planner is proposed which selects the robot's next position that maximizes the expected amount of new space that will be visible to the sensor. The planner also takes into account matching requirements for reliable self-localization of the robot, as well as physical limitations of the sensor (range, incidence).

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing. In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment. The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map. A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible. However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task. That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper. Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of 'good' positions, where 'good' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location. This is similar to the next-best-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics. However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence). The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots. To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far. The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step. The new position is chosen within the safe region in order to maximize the expected gain of information under the constraint that the local model at this new position must have a minimal overlap with the current global map. In the future, NBV and SLAM algorithms should reinforce each other. While a SLAM algorithm builds a map by making the best use of the available sensory data, an NBV algorithm, such as that proposed here, guides the navigation of the robot through positions selected to provide the best sensory inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {If $k$-flats in $ R^n, 0<k<n$, are considered, their associated Grassmann cone and their affine Grassmannian are not convex sets. Therefore, convexity operators on the Grassmannians are not canonical, but can be given in several ways. The authors present a new definition which fits into many applications. The basic idea is the use of a duality operator $^*$ that assigns to each set $\scr F$ of $k$-flats the set of all convex point sets meeting all members of $\scr F$, and that assigns to each set $\scr S$ of convex point sets the set of all $k$-flats meeting all the members of $\scr S$. Then ${\rm conv}\,{\scr F}$ is defined by ${\scr F}^{**}$. It is shown that this notion provides a rich structure. A number of examples and applications are given.},

Roughly speaking, such stratified systems have a configuration space which can be decomposed into sub-manifolds upon which the system has different sets of equations of motion. For such systems, considering the controllability is difficult because of the discontinuous form of the equations of motion. The main result in this paper is a controllability test, analogous to Chow's theorem, is based upon a construction involving distributions, and the extension thereof to robotic gaits.

  Abstract                 = {It is well-known that a suitably designed unpowered mechanical biped robot can "walk" down an inclined plane with a steady periodic gait. The energy required to maintain the motion comes from the conversion of the biped's gravitational potential energy as it descends. Investigation of such passive natural motions may potentially lead us to strategies useful for controlling active walking machines as well as to understand human locomotion. In this paper we demonstrate the existence and the stability of symmetric and asymmetric passive gaits using a simple nonlinear biped model. Kinematically the robot is identical to a double pendulum (similar to the Acrobot and the Pendubot) and is able to walk with the so-called compass gait. Using the passive behavior as a reference we also investigate the performance of several active control schemes. Active control can enlarge the basin of attraction of passive limit cycles and can create new gaits.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a systematic study of the passive gait of a compass-like, planar biped robot on inclined slopes. The robot is kinematically equivalent to a double pendulum, possessing two kneeless legs with point masses and a third point mass at the "hip" joint. The symmetric and steady stable gait of the unpowered robot gradually evolves through a regime of bifurcations characterized by progressively complicated asymmetric gaits, eventually arriving at an apparently chaotic gait where no two steps are identical. A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the stability of such gaits is the contraction of the "phase-fluid" volume. We present a novel graphical technique based on the first return map that compactly captures the entire evolution of the gait, from symmetry to chaos. Additional passive dissipative elements in the robot joint result in a significant improvement in the stability and the versatility of the gait, and provide a rich repertoire for simple control laws.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of the theory and practice of quantization dates to 1948, although similar ideas had appeared in the literature as long ago as 1898. The fundamental role of quantization in modulation and analog-to-digital conversion was first recognized during the early development of pulse-code modulation systems, especially in the 1948 paper of Oliver, Pierce, and Shannon. Also in 1948, Bennett published the first high-resolution analysis of quantization and an exact analysis of quantization noise for Gaussian processes, and Shannon published the beginnings of rate distortion theory, which would provide a theory for quantization as analog-to-digital conversion and as data compression. Beginning with these three papers of fifty years ago, we trace the history of quantization from its origins through this decade, and we survey the fundamentals of the theory and many of the popular and promising techniques for quantization.},

  Abstract                 = {When $n$ identical randomly located nodes, each capable of transmitting at $W$ bits per second and using a fixed range, form a wireless network, the throughput $\Lambda(n)$ obtainable by each node for a randomly chosen destination is $\Theta(W \sqrt{n log n})$ bits per second under a noninterference protocol. If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is $\Theta (W \sqrt{A n})$ bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only $\Theta (W \sqrt{n})$ bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.

  Abstract                 = {In this note we consider the following problem. Suppose a set of sensors is jointly trying to estimate a process. One sensor takes a measurement at every time step and the measurements are then exchanged among all the sensors. What is the sensor schedule that results in the minimum error covariance? We describe a stochastic sensor selection strategy that is easy to implement and is computationally tractable. The problem described above comes up in many domains out of which we discuss two. In the sensor selection problem, there are multiple sensors that cannot operate simultaneously (e.g., sonars in the same frequency band). Thus measurements need to be scheduled. In the sensor coverage problem, a geographical area needs to be covered by mobile sensors each with limited range. Thus from every position, the sensors obtain a different view-point of the area and the sensors need to optimize their trajectories. The algorithm is applied to these problems and illustrated through simple examples.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, numerous distributed algorithms have been proposed which, when executed by a team of dynamic agents, result in the completion of a joint task. However, for any such algorithm to be practical, one should be able to guarantee that the task is still satisfactorily executed even when agents fail to communicate with others or to perform their designated actions correctly. In this paper, we present a concept of robustness which is well-suited for general distributed algorithms for teams of dynamic agents. Our de nition extends a similar notion introduced in the distributed computation literature for consensus problems. We illustrate the de nition by considering a variety of algorithms and identify possible ways to make an algorithm robust.},

This restriction is quite rich and contains as special cases classical optimization problems such as matching and vertex cover for general graphs. It is shown that both the maximum integral multicommodity flow and the minimum multicut problem are NP-hard and MAX SNP-hard on trees, although the maximum integral flow can be computed in polynomial time if the edges have unit capacity. We present an efficient algorithm that computes a multicut and integral flow such that the weight of the multicut is at most twice the value of the flow. This gives a 2-approximation algorithm for minimum multicut and a 1/2-approximation algorithm for maximum integral multicommodity flow in trees.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of polynomial operators is considered and applied to the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, especially for purposes of automatic control. The approach is functional analytic, which makes it possible to apply the theory widely to most systems characterized by a polynomial type nonlinearity. The main result is a theorem concerning local invertibility of polynomial operators although also other important algebraic and topological properties are derived. The theorem shows how a local inverse can be constructed by a recursive representation and gives an explicitly determinable validity region for this representation. Applications are presented concerning differential equations with polynomial type generators, generally defined in Banach spaces. The local inverse theorem is used to find the solutions and to investigate stability and controllability properties of these equations. As an example the swing equation of a synchronous machine is considered. (29 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of the so-called generalized polynomial operators is considered and applied especially to systems described by certain types of nonlinear differential equ ations. A theorem concerning local invertibility of polynomial operators is given. By an example it is shown how this theorem can be used to prove the existence of solutions, to construct these solutions, and to find a region of BIBO stability of the aforementioned systems. The treatment is quite general, being based on functional analysis. In particular, it can be applied to the systems analyzed by using functional series of Volterra type. (10 References).},

The method is easy to program for a very general trajectory optimization problem and is shown to be very efficient for several sample problems.

First, we describe a distributed algorithm by which groups of agents can solve the full odor localization task more efficiently than a single agent. Next, we demonstrate that a group of real robots under fully distributed control can successfully traverse a real odor plume, and that an embodied simulator can faithfully reproduce these real robots experiments. Finally, we use the embodied simulator combined with a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize performance across group size, showing that it can be useful not only for improving real world odor localization, but also for quantitatively characterizing the influence of group size on task performance.},

First, we describe a distributed algorithm by which groups of agents can solve the full odor localization task. Next, we establish that conducting polymer-based odor sensors possess the combination of speed and sensitivity necessary to enable real world odor plume tracing and we demonstrate that simple local position, odor, and flow information, tightly coupled with robot behavior, is sufficient to allow a robot to localize the source of an odor plume. Finally, we show that elementary communication among a group of agents can increase the efficiency of the odor localization system performance.},

  Abstract                 = {An algorithm is presented for generating near-time-optimal trajectories for an open-kinematic-chain manipulator moving in a cluttered workspace. This is the first algorithm to guarantee bounds on the closeness of an approximation to a time-optimal trajectory. The running time and space required are polynomial in the desired accuracy of the approximation. The user may also specify tolerances by which the trajectories must clear obstacles in the workspace to allow modeling of control errors. (20 References). }

  Abstract                 = {The method of collocation and nonlinear programming has been used recently to solve a number of optimal control problems. In this method polynomials are commonly used to represent the state variable time histories over subintervals of the total time of interest. These polynomials correspond to a family of modified-Gaussian quadrature rules known as the Gauss-Lobatto rules. Presently, relatively low-order rules from the Gauss-Lobatto family, such as the trapezoid and Simpson`s rule, are used to construct collocation solution schemes. In this work higher-order Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules are formulated using collocation point selection based on a particular family of Jacobi polynomials. The advantage of using a quadrature rule of higher order is that the approximation using the higher degree polynomial may be more accurate, due to finite precision arithmetic, than a formulation based on a lower degree polynomial. In addition, the number of subintervals and, therefore, the number of nonlinear programming parameters needed to solve a problem accurately may be significantly reduced from that required if the conventional trapezoidal or Simpson`s quadrature schemes are used. An optimal trajectory maximizing final energy for a low-thrust spacecraft is used to demonstrate the benefits of using the higher-order schemes. (28 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The method of direct collocation and nonlinear programming presented works well when applied to the optimal control problem of satellite attitude control. The formulation is straightforward and produces good results in a relatively small amount of time on a Cray X/MP with no a priori information about the optimal solution. The addition of the joint acceleration to the controls significantly reduces the control magnitudes and optimal cost. The restrictions of constant external torques or zero external torque have an insignificant effect on the state and internal control histories and result in only a small increase in the optimal cost. In all cases, the torques and accelerations are modest and the optimal cost is very modest. (10 References).},

  Abstract                 = {An efficient, online terrain-covering algorithm is presented for a robot (AUV) moving in an unknown three-dimensional underwater environment. Such an algorithm is necessary for producing mosaicked images of the ocean floor. The basis of this three-dimensional motion planning algorithm is a new planar algorithm for nonsimply connected areas with boundaries of arbitrary shape. We show that this algorithm generalizes naturally to complex three-dimensional environments in which the terrain to be covered is projectively planar. This planar algorithm represents an improvement over previous algorithms because it results in a shorter path length for the robot and does not assume a polygonal environment. The path length of our algorithm is shown to be linear in the size of the area to be covered; the amount of memory required by the robot to implement the algorithm is linear in the size of the description of the boundary of the area. An example is provided that demonstrates the algorithm's performance in a nonsimply connected, nonplanar environment. (16 References).},

The variable constraint mechanism is a system that actively changes constraint conditions by itself in response to the working purpose or the required motion sequence to acquire varied functionality. The paper discusses some of the generalized design principles for the mechanism and shows some example robotic systems, including an adjustable leg-length walking robot, a legged and wheeled hybrid vehicle, an autonomous multisection robot, and a planetary rover with collapsible frame and compressible wheels.},

Each subset selected must satisfy some structural constraints. We analyze the quality of a $k$-stage covering algorithm that relies, at each stage, on greedily selecting a subset that gives maximum improvement in terms of overall coverage. We show that such greedily constructed solutions are guaranteed to be within a factor of $1-1/e$ of the optimal solution. In some cases, selecting a best solution at each stage may itself be difficult; we show that if a $\beta$-approximate best solution is chosen at each stage, then the overall solution constructed is guaranteed to be within a factor of $1-1/e^\beta$ of the optimal. Our results also yield a simple proof that the number of subsets used by the greedy approach to achieve entire coverage of the universal set is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal number of subsets. We discuss examples of problems that fall into the family of general covering problems considered, and for which the algorithmic results apply.},

For each simulation, we compare the computed motion to that of humans performing similar maneuvers. We perform the comparison both qualitatively through real and simulated video images and quantitatively through simulated and biomechanical data. (31 References)},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile manipulator systems hold promise in many industrial and service applications including assembly, inspection, and work in hazardous environments. The integration of a manipulator and a mobile robot base places special demands on the vehicle's drive system. For smooth accurate motion and coordination with an on-board manipulator, a holonomic vibration-free wheel system that can be dynamically controlled is needed. In this paper, we present the design and development of a powered caster vehicle (PCV), which is shown to possess the desired mechanical properties. To dynamically control the PCV, a new approach for modeling and controlling the dynamics of this parallel redundant system is proposed. The experimental results presented in the paper illustrate the performance of this platform and demonstrate the significance of dynamic control and its effectiveness in mobile manipulation tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {An open loop vibrational control for underactuated mechanical systems with amplitude and frequency modulation is investigated. Since there is no direct external input to an unactuated joint, the dynamic coupling between the actuated and unactuated joint is utilized for controlling the unactuated joint. Feedback linearization has been performed to incorporate fully the known nonlinearities of the underactuated system considered. The actuated joints are firstly positioned to their desired locations, and then periodic oscillatory inputs are applied to the actuated joints to move the remaining unactuated joints to their target positions. The amplitudes and frequencies of the vibrations introduced are determined through the averaging analysis. A systematic way of obtaining an averaged system for the underactuated system via a coordinate transformation is developed. A manipulator in the space where no gravitation exists can be vibrationally controlled in the event of actuator failure. A control design example of a 2R planar manipulator with a free joint with no brake is provided. (7 References).},

The interceptor vehicle can use both conventional rocket propulsion and, if optimal or necessary, aerodynamic forces to change its orbit. The problem is solved using a direct method, collocation with nonlinear programming, in which the continuous optimal control problem is converted into a discrete problem. Both minimum time and minimum-fuel trajectories are found. The sensitivity of the optimal trajectories to atmospheric heating-rate constraints is determined. An interesting result is that some minimum-time trajectories enter the atmosphere and use aerodynamic forces for orbit change even when there is sufficient propellant available to accomplish the interception ballistically.

These are nonholonomic systems with a five-dimensional (5-D) configuration space and three independent velocities. They consist of a sphere rolling in contact with two horizontal plates. Kinematic models of sphere-plate systems have played an important role in the control systems literature addressing the kinematics of rolling bodies, as well as in discussions of nonholonomic systems. However, kinematic analysis falls short of allowing one to understand the dynamic behavior of such systems. We formulate and study a dynamic model for a class of sphere-plate systems in order to answer the question: -is it possible to impart a net angular momentum to a sphere which rolls without slipping between two plates, given that the position of the top plate is subject to exogenous forces?".

  Abstract                 = {Finding paths in high-dimensional geometric spaces is a provably hard problem. Recently, a general randomized planning scheme has emerged as an effective approach to solve this problem. In this scheme, the planner samples the space at random and build a network of simple paths, called a probabilistic roadmap. This paper describes a basic probabilistic roadmap planner, which is easily parallelizable, and provides a formal analysis that explains its empirical success when the space satisfies two geometric properties called epsilon -goodness and expansiveness.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we study conflict resolution for multiple aircraft encounter situations on a plane. First, the homotopy types of resolution maneuvers for n aircraft encounters are classified according to their images in the joint space-time coordinates, which are shown to bear a one-to-one correspondence with the well-known pure braid group. Energy is then proposed as the cost function for choosing among all conflict-free maneuvers the optimal one. For two aircraft encounters, analytic expressions of the optimal resolution maneuvers are obtained, and for the multiple aircraft case, convex optimization technique is used to find the optimal two-legged resolution maneuver within each type. The introduced solution, however, becomes computationally intractable as the number of aircraft increases. The use of a probabilistic resolution algorithm as ``random type chooser'' is then suggested as a randomized solution to the combinatorial optimization problem. Finally, simulation results are presented for some typical encounters.},

  Abstract                 = {Robotic coverage is the problem of moving a sensor or actuator over all points in a given region. Ultimately, we want a coverage path that minimizes some cost such as time. We take the approach of decomposing the coverage region into subregions, selecting a sequence of those subregions, and then generating a path that covers each subregion in turn. In this paper, we focus on generating decompositions based upon the planar line sweep. After a general overview of the coverage problem, we describe how our assumptions lead to the optimality criterion of minimizing the sum of subregion altitudes (which are measured relative to the sweep direction assigned to that subregion). For a line-sweep decomposition, the sweep direction is the same for all subregions. We describe how to find the optimal sweep direction for convex polygonal worlds. We then introduce the minimal sum of altitudes (MSA) decomposition in which we may assign a different sweep direction to each subregion. This decomposition is better for generating an optimal coverage path. We describe a method based on multiple line sweeps and dynamic programming to generate the MSA decomposition.},

  Abstract                 = {Many animals have the ability to search for odor sources by tracking their plumes. Some of the key features of this search behavior have been successfully transferred to robot platforms, although the capabilities of animals are still beyond the current level of sensor technologies. The examples described in this paper are (1) incorporating into a wheeled robot the upwind surges and casting used by moths in tracking pheromone plumes, (2) extracting useful information from the response patterns of a chemical sensor array patterned after the spatially distributed chemoreceptors of some animals, and (3) mimicking the fanning behavior of silkworm moths to enhance the reception of chemical signals by drawing molecules from one direction. The achievements so far and current efforts are reviewed to illustrate the steps to be taken toward future development of this technology.},

  Abstract                 = {In a recent Physical Review Letters article, Vicsek et al. propose a simple but compelling discrete-time model of n autonomous agents (i.e., points or particles) all moving in the plane with the same speed but with different headings. Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its "neighbors." In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.},

Using tools from spectral graph theory and control theory, we prove that for couplings above a critical value all the oscillators synchronize, resulting in convergence of all phase differences to a constant value, both in the case of identical natural frequencies as well as uncertain ones. We also provide a series of bounds for the critical values of the coupling strenght.},

  Abstract                 = {Many future air traffic control tasks will require online safety-critical optimization algorithms. Among these tasks, real-time air traffic conflict resolution involving more than two aircraft is one of the most challenging. Air traffic control systems based on online optimization algorithms must face safety-certification issues such as guaranteed feasibility and guaranteed time of computation. This paper deals with the question of guaranteed feasibility and presents an initial effort at developing an off-line procedure to prove the safety of such an algorithm. The procedure is based on convex optimization technology combined with the so-called S-procedure. (16 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Probabilistic sampling-based algorithms, such as the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms, represent one of the most successful approaches to robotic motion planning, due to their strong theoretical properties (in terms of probabilistic completeness or even asymptotic optimality) and remarkable practical performance. Such algorithms are probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and identically distributed random points in the configuration space. Their randomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including certification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation to improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether similar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be obtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences. The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question. Specifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is deterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the convergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very explicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence and the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal version of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close to O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the sequence. This is in stark contrast to the O(n logn) complexity results for existing asymptotically-optimal probabilistic planners. Finally, through numerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic low-dispersion sampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and success rate.},

This result is then extended to consider unbounded communication delays between members and complete failure of individual members of the collective. (9 References).},

We derive models for the concentration distribution using the diffusion equation and finite element approximations. Using these results, we develop parametric statistical models and a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm to find the parameters of the biochemical agent. To detect the presence of a source, we develop a generalized likelihood ratio test. We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques through numerical examples.

  Abstract                 = {We develop methods for automatic detection and localization of landmines using chemical sensor arrays and statistical signal processing techniques. The transport of explosive vapors emanating from buried landmines is modeled as a diffusion process in a two-layered system consisting of ground and air. Measurement and statistical models are then obtained from the associated concentration distribution. We derive two detectors (the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test and the mean detector) and determine their performance in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection. To determine the unknown location of a landmine, we derive a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm and evaluate its performance by computing the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). The results are applied to the design of chemical sensor arrays, satisfying criteria specified in terms of detection and estimation performance measures and for optimally selecting the number and positions of sensors and the number of time samples. To illustrate the potential of the proposed techniques in a realistic demining scenario, we derive a moving-sensor algorithm in which the stationary sensor array is replaced by a single moving sensor. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of our results},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a framework to deal with the problem of global stabilization and global tracking control for the kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot in the presence of input saturations. A model-based control design strategy is developed via a simple application of passivity and normalization. Saturated, Lipschitz continuous, time-varying feedback laws are obtained and illustrated in a number of compelling simulations. (25 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we study the input-to-state stability (iss) property for discrete-time nonlinear systems. It is shown that most iss results for continuous-time nonlinear systems in the current literature can be extended to the discrete-time case. Several equivalent characterizations of iss are introduced and two iss small-gain theorems are proved for nonlinear and interconnected discrete-time systems. ISS stabilizability is discussed and comparisons with the continuous-time case are made. As in the continuous time framework, where the notion iss found wide applications, we expect that this notion will provide a useful tool in areas related to stability and stabilization for nonlinear discrete time systems as well.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous team of UAVs drawn from several distinct classes and engaged in a search and destroy mission over an extended battlefield. Several different types of targets are considered. Some target locations are suspected upriori with a certain probability, while the others are initially unknown. During the mission, the UAVs perform Search, Conjbm, Attack and Battle Danlage Assessment (BDA) tasks at various locations. The target locations are detected gradually through search, while the tasks are determined in real-time by the actions of all UAVs and their results (e.g., sensor readings), which makes the task dynamics stochastic. The tasks must, therefore, be allocated to UAVs in real-time as they arise. Each class of UAVs has its own sensing and attack capabilities with respect to the different target types, so the need for appropriate and efficient assignment is paramount. We present a simple cooperative approach to this problem, based on distributed assignment mediated through centralized mission status information. Using this information, each UAV assesses the task opportunities available to it, and makes commitments through a phased incremental process. This produces a simple, flexible, scalable and inherently decentralizable method for task allocation. Concurrently, every UAV also monitors the degree to which various parts of the environment have been searched, and accommodates this information in planning its paths. We study the effect of various decision parameters, target distributions, and UAV team characteristics on the performance of our approach.},

This analysis clarifies the criterion for including communication between the vehicles. A simple numerical example is given to explain the main ideas and some interesting design issues},

Actively employing symmetries-here families of dilations-of nilpotent approximating systems, the problem is basically reduced to questions about relative locations and intersection properties of certain varieties in a lower dimensional space, typically (n-1)-dimensional projective space. Special consideration is given to the three dimensional case, with explicit examples, a discussion of Brockett's condition, and a new necessary condition for the existence of continuous homogeneous feedback laws that asymptotically stabilize.},

  Abstract                 = {Analyses the stability and fairness of two classes of rate control algorithm for large-scale broadband communication networks. The algorithms provide natural generalisations to large-scale networks of simple additive increase/multiplicative decrease schemes, and are shown to be stable about a system optimum characterised by a proportional fairness criterion. Stability is established by showing that, with an appropriate formulation of the overall optimisation problem, the network's implicit objective function provides a Lyapunov function for the dynamical system defined by the rate control algorithm. The network's optimisation problem may be cast in primal or dual form: this leads naturally to two classes of algorithm, which may be interpreted in terms of either congestion indication feedback signals or explicit rates based on shadow prices. Both classes of algorithm may be generalised to include routing control, and provide natural implementations of proportionally fair pricing. (26 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a planar model for the swimming of certain marine animals based on reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for the interaction of a rigid body and an incompressible fluid. This model assumes the form of a control-affine nonlinear system with drift; preliminary accessibility analysis suggests its utility in predicting efficacious gaits for piscimimetic robots. We account for the generation of thrust due to vortex shedding through controlled coupling terms. At the heart of this coupling is an abstraction from the hydrofoil theory. We investigate its applicability to real swimming using an articulated robotic caudal fin. We compare the observed behaviour of our experimental apparatus to that predicted numerically by the steady hydrodynamic theory. (23 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Deals with the optimal sensor location problem associated with minimax filtering for linear distributed parameter systems under the moving sensors. The problem of optimal choice of a measurement trajectory is treated as an H/sup infinity /-optimal control one under phase constraints with the objective to minimize a given 'weak' performance index under 'worst' possible disturbances. Existence of a solution to such a problem is established for the case of quadratic constraints on the disturbances and necessary conditions for optimality are derived on the basis of constructing a sequence of suboptimal solutions associated, in turn, with a sequence of finite-dimensional maximum principles.

  Abstract                 = {In many cooperative control problems, a shared knowledge of information provides the basis for cooperation. When this information is different for each agent, a state of noncooperation can result. Consensus algorithms ensure that after some time the agents will agree on the information critical for coordination, called the coordination variable. In this paper we show that if the coordination algorithm is input-to-state stable where the input is considered to be the discrepancy between the coordination variable known to each vehicle, then cooperation is guaranteed when a consensus scheme is used to synchronize information. A coordinated timing example is shown in simulation to illustrate the notions of stability when a coordination algorithm is augmented with a consensus strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the scalability of multi-robot algorithms. In particular, we attempt to capture the idea that the less coordination a multi-robot system requires, the better it should scale to large numbers of robots. To that end, we introduce a notion of communication complexity of multi-robot (or more generally, distributed control) systems as a surrogate for coordination. We describe a formalism, called CCL, for specifying multi-robot systems and algorithms for which the de nition of communication complexity arises naturally. We then analyze the communication complexity of several, in some cases novel, multi-robot communication schemes each representative of one of several natural complexity classes.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the Computation and Control Language (CCL), a guarded-command formalism for expressing systems wherein control and computation are intertwined. A CCL program consists of a set of guarded commands that update continuous or discrete variables. CCL programs are used to specify systems and program them. Their properties can be analyzed using temporal logic. In this paper, a robot capture-the-flag system, called the "RoboFlag Drill," is encoded in CCL and certain desirable properties of it are verified. The example consists of a self-stabilizing communications protocol whose behavior depends on the actions taken by the robots in their environment. The paper concludes with a brief overview of our initial implementation of the formal semantics of CCL as a practical programming language.},

Such partitions are of great importance to computer science and many other fields. The challenge is to compute Voronoi diagrams quickly. The problem is that their structure depends on the notion of distance and the sort of site. In this book the author proposes a unifying approach by introducing abstract Voronoi diagrams. These are based on the concept of bisecting curves, which are required to have some simple properties that are actually possessed by most bisectors of concrete Voronoi diagrams. Abstract Voronoi diagrams can be computed efficiently and there exists a worst-case efficient algorithm of divide-and-conquer type that applies to all abstract Voronoi diagrams satisfying a certain constraint. The author shows that this constraint is fulfilled by the concrete diagrams based on large classes of metrics in the plane.},

  Abstract                 = {Voronoi diagrams were introduced by R. Klein (1988) as an axiomatic basis of Voronoi diagrams. The authors show how to construct abstract Voronoi diagrams in time O(n log n) by a randomized algorithm, which is based on Clarkson and Shor's randomized incremental construction technique (1989). The new algorithm has the following advantages over previous algorithms: it can handle a much wider class of abstract Voronoi diagrams than the algorithms presented by Klein (1989) and Mehlhorn, Meiser and O'Dunlaing (1991). It can be adapted to a concrete kind of Voronoi diagram by providing a single basic operation, namely the construction of a Voronoi diagram of five sites. Moreover, all geometric decisions are confined to the basic operation, and using this operation, abstract Voronoi diagrams can be constructed in a purely combinatorial manner. (22 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers motion planning for small satellites such as CubeSats performing proximity operations in a several meters range of a target object. The main goal is to develop a principled methodology for handling the coupled effects of orbital dynamics, rotational and translational rigid-body dynamics, underactuation and control bounds, and obstacle avoidance constraints. The proposed approach is based on constructing a reduced-order parameterization of the dynamics through dynamics inversion and differential flatness, and on efficient global optimization over a finite-dimensional reduced representation. Two simulated scenarios, a satellite reconfiguration maneuver and asteroid surface sampling, are developed to illustrate the approach. In addition, a simple two-dimensional experimental testbed consisting of an air-bearing table and two CubeSat engineering models is developed for partial testing and integration of the proposed methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Assembly problems require that a robot with fewer actuated degrees of freedom manipulates an environment containing a greater number of unactuated degrees of freedom. From the perspective of control theory, these problems hold considerable interest because they are characterized by the presence of non-holonomic constraints that preclude the possibility of feedback stabilization. In this sense they necessitate the introduction of a hierarchical controller. This paper explores these issues in the simple instance when all of the pieces to be assembled are constrained to lie on a line. A hierarchical controller is devised for this problem and is shown to be correct: the closed loop system achieves any desired final assembly from all initial configurations that lie in its connected component in configuration space; the generated sequence of motions never causes collisions between two pieces. Further examination of this approach interprets the controller's mediation of conflicting subgoals as promoting an M-player game amongst the pieces to be assembled. (48 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The first step in processing olfactory information, before neural filtering, is the physical capture of odor molecules from the surrounding fluid. Many animals capture odors from turbulent water currents or wind using antennae that bear chemosensory hairs. We used planar laser-induced fluorescence to reveal how lobster olfactory antennules hydrodynamically alter the spatiotemporal patterns of concentration in turbulent odor plumes. As antennules flick, water penetrates their chemosensory hair array during the fast downstroke, carrying fine-scale patterns of concentration into the receptor area. This spatial pattern, blurred by flow along the antennule during the downstroke, is retained during the slower return stroke and is not shed until the next flick.},

  Abstract                 = {The in-situ exploration of small Solar System bodies (such as asteroids or comets) is becoming a central objective for future planetary exploration. Such bodies are characterized by very weak gravitational fields, which make hopping mobility platforms one of the preferred mobility strategies for microgravity surface exploration, as recognized by space agencies worldwide. However, little is known about the dynamical behavior of hopping platforms in low gravity environments, where small bodies' rotational dynamics can have a critical effect. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to study in detail the �dynamic envelope� of hopping microgravity rovers, with a focus on internal actuation. Specifically, we first perform a static analysis with the goal of determining regions of a small body where an internally-actuated hopping rover can stably remain at rest. Then, we perform a dynamic analysis and discuss the actuation and instrument pointing performance of hopping microgravity platforms as a function of a number of system and environmental parameters (e.g., rover shape, body rotation rate). Finally, we tailor our analysis to a potential mission to Mars' moon Phobos. Collectively, our results show that internally-actuated rovers, from an actuation standpoint, are a viable mobility solution for a vast class of small Solar System bodies. Also, our analysis represents a key first step to develop path planning algorithms for microgravity explorers to safely explore dynamically feasible regions.},

  Abstract                 = {A class of nonholonomic control systems in extended power form is studied. It is demonstrated that under appropriate assumptions Lagrange's equations, including classical nonholonomic constraints, can be transformed into the extended power form. A switched mode feedback controller is used to obtain global convergence of the states of the extended power form to the origin. This feedback controller can be interpreted as a hybrid system consisting of a high level discrete event supervisor and a family of low level feedback controllers. The closed loop system exhibits finite-time responses.},

  Abstract                 = {This article proposes a complete parallel relational optimization methodology based on randomized search strategies from the theoretical basics to the experimental validation. This methodology is based on a survey-like analysis of related search techniques. We defend why randomized search strategies are an effective technique, both in output quality and optimization effort, for complex parallel query optimization. The traditional techniques are tuned and parallelized versions are developed. Furthermore we describe how the transformation rules of the search strategy could interact with the resource allocation and present an allocation model. A series of experiments performed on a 100 relation database with 18 randomly chosen queries demonstrate that an excellent tradeoff between optimization time and optimization quality can be achieved.

  Abstract                 = {The problem of cooperative fusion in the presence of both Byzantine sensors and misinformed sensors is considered. An information theoretic formulation is used to characterize the Shannon capacity of sensor fusion. It is shown that when there are fewer Byzantine sensors than honest sensors, the effect of Byzantine attack can be entirely mitigated, and the fusion capacity is identical to that when all sensors are honest. However, when at least as many sensors are Byzantine as are honest, the Byzantine sensors can completely defeat the sensor fusion so that no information can be transmitted reliably. A capacity achieving transmit-then-verify strategy is proposed for the case that fewer sensors are Byzantine than honest, and its error probability and coding rate is analyzed by using a {M}arkov decision process modeling of the transmission protocol.},

The first is a generalization of the work of Chow and others concerning the set of locally accessible points of a nonlinear control system. It is shown that under quite general conditions, this set lies on a surface in state space and has a nonempty interior in the relative topology of that surface. The second result generalizes the bang-bang theorem to nonlinear control systems using higher order control variations as developed by Kelley and others. As a corollary we obtain Halkin's bang bang theorem for a linear piecewise analytic control system. (20 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Concerns motion generation via cyclic variations in selected degrees of freedom (shape variables) in mechanical systems subject to nonholonomic constraints (here, a disk rolling without sliding on a flat surface). It is necessary to take into account certain dynamical phenomena. We consider the group SE(2) of rigid motions in the plane and a concrete mechanical realization, the SE(2)-snake. One version of this is the Roller Racer (a patented toy). Based on the work of Bloch, Krishnaprasad, Marsden and Murray (1995), one recognizes in the example a balance law called the momentum equation, which is a direct consequence of the interaction of the SE(2)-symmetry of the problem with the constraints. The systematic use of this law results in certain structures which are used to demonstrate that the single shape freedom in this problem can be cyclically varied to produce a rich variety of motions of the SE(2)-snake. In their study of the Snakeboard, a patented modification of the skateboard that also admits the group SE(2) as a symmetry group, Lewis, Ostrowski, Burdick and Murray (1994) exploited the same type of balance law, but in this paper we have only one control variable and thus controllability considerations become somewhat more delicate. In the present paper, we give a self-contained treatment of the geometry mechanics and motion control of the Roller Racer.},

This places land forces in dangerous and unpredictable situations, and in many instances the conflicts also threaten noncombatants. To address this need, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Mobile Robotics program is researching and developing the capability to perform urban reconnaissance with teams of small, low-cost, semi-autonomous mobile robots. Easily transportable by individuals, these robot teams will be capable of working together to perform a variety of reconnaissance functions. The program develops enabling technologies (machine perception, autonomous operation, and robotic locomotion) and integrates them into tactical systems for urban operations. (5 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Passive dynamic walking refers to a class of bipedal machines that are able to walk down a gentle slope with no external control or energy input. The legs swing naturally as pendula and conservation of angular momentum governs the contact of the swing foot with the ground. Previous machines have been limited to planar motions. The authors extend the planar motions to allow for tilting from side to side (roll motion). Passive walking cycles exist, but the roll motion is unstable, resembling that of an inverted pendulum. The instability is due to mismatching of roll velocity with the ground contact conditions. Several strategies are presented for stabilizing this motion, of which the quasi-static control of step width is determined to be both simple and efficient. (11 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

A complete algorithm is presented and is based on critical visibility events that occur because of inflections and bitangents on the environment boundary. By generalizing the notion of inflections and bitangents to polygonal and piecewise-smooth environments, the approach is considered as a step toward developing pursuit-evasion strategies that have little dependency on the representation of the environment},

  Abstract                 = {During the last three decades motion planning has emerged as a crucial and productive research area in robotics. In the mid-80's the most advanced planners were barely able to compute collision-free paths for objects crawling in planar workspaces. Today, planners efficiently deal with robots with many degrees of freedom in complex environments. Techniques also exist to generate quasi-optimal trajectories, coordinate multiple robots, deal with dynamic and kinematic constraints, and handle dynamic environments. This paper describes some of these achievements, presents new problems that have recently emerged, discusses applications likely to motivate future research, and finally gives expectations for the coming YEARs. It stresses the fact that non-robotics applications (e.g., graphic animation, surgical planning, computational biology) are growing in importance and are likely to shape future motion planning research more than robotics itself.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the problem of motion planning for a car-like robot (i.e., a mobile robot with a nonholonomic constraint whose turning radius is lower-bounded). We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an appropriate metric in the configuration space R2 x S1 of the robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that the new induced topology and the classical one are the same. Although we concentration upon the car-like robot, the generalization of these techniques leads to new theoretical issues involving sub-Riemannian geometry and to practical results for nonholonomic motion planning.},

  Abstract                 = {The Crewman's Associate for Path Control (CAPC) is an automatic road-departure warning system for motor vehicle drivers. This article presents the design of, and preliminary field results from, the CAPC prototype vehicle, a modified 1995 Ford Taurus SHO. The CAPC system is intended for highway drivers who are drifting off the roadway at a shallow angle of departure due to inattention, drowsiness, intoxication, or other causes. A camera senses the roadway ahead, and a suite of transducers provide measurements of vehicle motion and driver steering commands. These are used to anticipate unintended road departures and warn the driver. Warning and intervention functions for CAPC have been developed during ongoing research at the University of Michigan; the algorithms are reviewed here in the context of the prototype. The prototype hardware and software are described in detail, and preliminary experimental data from the field is presented. (23 References).},

When the control enters linearly, dx/dt=f(x)+ug(x), the method yields the existence of a Volterra series representation. The proof is constructive and explicitly exhibits the kernels. It depends on standard mathematical tools such as the fundamental theorem of calculus and the Cauchy estimates for the Taylor series coefficients of analytic functions. In addition, the uniqueness of Volterra series representations is discussed.},

The curvature of these constraints enters the expression for the averaged system. For example, the curvature of the pursuit curve enters the averaged equation of the pendulum with vibrating suspension point. This observation gives a new physical and geometrical insight into the mechanics of the Paul traps and the stability of forced inverted pendula. (30 References).},

The main result of this note is a geometrical representation of the reconstruction problem for SO(3) in terms of parallel transport. It is, of course, well known that the solution of a linear equation x= Omega (t)x in R/sup n/ cannot in general be expressed by x(t)=e( integral /sub 0//sup t/)/sup Omega ( tau /d tau )x(0) (false) because the coefficient matrices Omega (t/sub 1/) and Omega (t/sub 2/) may fail to commute for t/sub 1/ not=t/sub 2/. Nevertheless, when n=3 and when Omega (t) is skew-symmetric, i.e. when it lies in the Lie algebra of the group of rigid rotations in R/sup 3/, the above false formula is almost correct, as we will show here. The main result of this note is a geometrical expression for the matrix solution X(t) of matrix equations on TSO(3) of the form X= Omega (t)X, Omega /sup T/=- Omega (*) where X, Omega are 3*3 matrices with real coefficients. The argument relies on a theorem of Poinsot together with some observations on geodesic curvatures of moving curves. (18 References).},

As a second application, he gives a solution of a problem posed by R. Brockett. As a third application, he gives a geometrical description of 'Berry's phase' in SO(3); this can be applied to various rigid-elastic systems to compute their geometric phases. (16 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a setting where multiple vehicles form a team cooperating to visit multiple target points and collect rewards associated with them. The team objective is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. Complicating factors include uncertainties regarding the locations of target points and the effectiveness of collecting rewards, differences among vehicle capabilities, and the fact that rewards are time-varying. We propose a receding horizon (RH) controller suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments, where combinatorially complex assignment algorithms are infeasible. The control scheme dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. This centralized scheme can generate stationary trajectories in the sense that they guide vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not explicitly designed to perform any discrete point assignments. This paper establishes conditions under which this stationarity property holds in settings that are analytically tractable, quantifies the cooperative properties of the controller, and includes a number of illustrative simulation examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous vehicles with plume-tracing capabilities would be valuable for finding chemical sources in fluid flows. This article considers strategies allowing autonomous vehicles to find and trace an odor plume to its source. These strategies are inspired by the maneuvers of moths flying upwind along a pheromone plume. Although moth maneuvers are well documented, the mechanisms underlying sensory perception and navigation are not fully understood; therefore, a key objective was to define sensor, signal-processing, and actuation algorithms for autonomous vehicles. The strategies presented do not precisely mimic insect orientation to odors. Optimizing performance, however, suggests orientation strategies that may have biological counterparts. The results demonstrate the importance of cross-plume counterturning strategies for maintaining intermittent contact with the chemical plume, given noisy sensory information. It is important for the searcher to maintain intermittent contact with the plume because flow direction while detecting odor is the main indicator of the instantaneous desired direction of motion.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a behavior-based adaptive mission planner (AMP)to trace a chemical plume to its source and reliably declare the source location. The proposed AMP is implemented on a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with multiple types of sensors that measure chemical concentration, the flow velocity vector, and AUV position, depth, altitude, attitude, and speed. This paper describes the methods and results from experiments conducted in November 2002 on San Clemente Island, CA, using a plume of Rhodamine dye developed in a turbulent fluid flow (i.e., near-shore ocean conditions). These experiments demonstrated chemical plume tracing over 100 m and source declaration accuracy relative to the nominal source location on the order of tens of meters. The designed maneuvers are divided into four behavior types: finding a plume,tracing the plume, reacquiring the plume, and declaring the source location. The tracing and reacquiring behaviors are inspired by male moths flying up wind along a pheromone plume to locate a sexually receptive female. All behaviors are formulated by perception and action modules and translated into chemical plume-tracing algorithms suitable for implementation on a REMUS AUV. To coordinate the different behaviors, the subsumption architecture is adopted to define and arbitrate the behavior priorities. AUVs capable of such feats would have applicability in searching for environmentally interesting phenomena, unexploded ordnance, undersea wreckage, and sources of hazardous chemicals or pollutants.},

  Abstract                 = {Given a set of wireless network nodes N, the directed weighted transmission graph Gt has an edge uv if and only if node v is in the transmission range of node u and the weight of uv is typically defined as |uv| + c for a real constant...... The minimum power topology Gm is the smallest subgraph of Gt that contains the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. We described a distributed position-based networking protocol to construct the enclosure graph Ge, which is an approximation of Gm. The total communication complexity is O(n). Let dG(u) be the degree of node u in a graph G. The time complexity of each node u is O (dGt)). The space required at each node is O(dGt (u. This improves the previous result that approximates GmO(dGt(u)3) time using O(dGt(u2) spaces. We also show that the average degree dGe (u) is usually a constant, which is at most 6. Our result is first developed for stationary network and then extended to mobile network.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of achieving a specified formation among a group of mobile autonomous agents by distributed control is studied. If convergence to a point is feasible, then more general formations are achievable too, so the focus is on convergence to a point (the agreement problem). Three formation strategies are studied and convergence is proved under certain conditions. Also, motivated by the question of whether collisions occur, formation evolution is studied.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivated by aerospace applications, this paper presents a methodology to use second-order cone programming to solve nonconvex optimal control problems. The nonconvexity arises from the presence of concave state inequality constraints and nonlinear terminal equality constraints. The development relies on a solution paradigm, in which the concave inequality constraints are approximated by successive linearization. Analysis is performed to establish the guaranteed satisfaction of the original inequality constraints, the existence of the successive solutions, and the equivalence of the solution of the original problem to the converged successive solution. These results lead to a rigorous proof of the convergence of the successive solutions under appropriate conditions as well as nonconservativeness of the converged solution. The nonlinear equality constraints are treated in a two-step procedure in which the constraints are first approximated by first-order expansions, then compensated by second-order corrections in each of the successive problems for enhanced convergence robustness. Applications in highly constrained spacecraft rendezvous and proximity operations, finite-thrust orbital transfers, and optimal launch ascent are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {Bacteria, bees, and birds often work together in groups to find food. A group of robots can be designed to coordinate their activities to search for and collect objects. Networked cooperative uninhabited autonomous vehicles are being developed for commercial and military applications. Suppose that we refer to all such groups of entities as "social foraging swarms." In order for such multiagent systems to succeed it is often critical that they can both maintain cohesive behaviors and appropriately respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., by optimizing the acquisition of nutrients in foraging for food). In this paper, we characterize swarm cohesiveness as a stability property and use a Lyapunov approach to develop conditions under which local agent actions will lead to cohesive foraging even in the presence of "noise" characterized by uncertainty on sensing other agent's position and velocity, and in sensing nutrients that each agent is foraging for. The results quantify earlier claims that social foraging is in a certain sense superior to individual foraging when noise is present, and provide clear connections between local agent-agent interactions and emergent group behavior. Moreover, the simulations show that very complicated but orderly group behaviors, reminiscent of those seen in biology, emerge in the presence of noise.},

  Abstract                 = {Coordinated dynamical swarm behavior occurs when certain types of animals forage for food or try to avoid predators. Analogous behaviors can occur in engineering systems (e.g., in groups of autonomous mobile robots or air vehicles). In this paper, we study a model of an M-dimensional (M/spl ges/2) asynchronous swarm with a fixed communication topology, where each member only communicate with fixed neighbors, to provide conditions under which collision-free convergence can be achieved with finite-size swarm members that have proximity sensors, and neighbor position sensors that only provide delayed position information. Moreover, we give conditions under which an M-dimensional asynchronous mobile swarm with a fixed communication topology following an "edge-leader" can maintain cohesion during movements even in the presence of sensing delays and asynchronism. In addition, the swarm movement flexibility is analyzed. Such stability analysis is of fundamental importance if one wants to understand the coordination mechanisms for groups of autonomous vehicles or robots, where intermember communication channels are less than perfect and collisions must be avoided.},

  Abstract                 = {Topology control problems are concerned with the assignment of power values to the nodes of an ad hoc network so that the power assignment leads to a graph topology satisfying some specified properties. This paper considers such problems under several optimization objectives, including minimizing the maximum power and minimizing the total power. A general approach leading to a polynomial algorithm is presented for minimizing maximum power for a class of graph properties called monotone properties. The difficulty of generalizing the approach to properties that are not monotone is discussed. Problems involving the minimization of total power are known to be NP-complete even for simple graph properties. A general approach that leads to an approximation algorithm for minimizing the total power for some monotone properties is presented. Using this approach, a new approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the total power for obtaining a 2-node-connected graph is developed. It is shown that this algorithm provides a constant performance guarantee. Experimental results from an implementation of the approximation algorithm are also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite (1951) that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemes for 2/sup b/ quanta, b=1,2,...,7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes. (13 References).},

We view network links and sources as processors of a distributed computation system to solve the dual problem using a gradient projection algorithm. In this system, sources select transmission rates that maximize their own benefits, utility minus bandwidth cost, and network links adjust bandwidth prices to coordinate the sources' decisions. We allow feedback delays to be different, substantial, and time varying, and links and sources to update at different times and with different frequencies. We provide asynchronous distributed algorithms and prove their convergence in a static environment. We present measurements obtained from a preliminary prototype to illustrate the convergence of the algorithm in a slowly time-varying environment. We discuss its fairness property. (32 References).},

This problem arises in applications that require choosing how to arrange or how to move objects without collisions. The approach presented here is based on characterizing the position and orientation of an object as a single point in a configuration space, in which each coordinate represents a degree of freedom in the position or orientation of the object. The configurations forbidden to this object, due to the presence of other objects, can then be characterized as regions in the configuration space, called configuration space obstacles. The paper presents algorithms for computing these configuration space obstacles when the objects are polygons or polyhedra.},

The proposed method is based on a recently introduced iterative steering paradigm, which prescribes the repeated application of an error contracting open-loop control law. In order to compute efficiently such a law, the dynamic equations of the robot are transformed via partial feedback linearization and nilpotent approximation. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a laboratory prototype. (30 References).},

  Abstract                 = { An approach is presented for the robust stabilization of nonlinear systems. The proposed strategy can be adopted whenever it is possible to compute a control law that steers the state in finite time from any initial condition to a point closer to the desired equilibrium. Under suitable assumptions, such control law can be applied in an iterative fashion, obtaining uniform asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point, with exponential rate of convergence. Small non-persistent perturbations are rejected, while persistent perturbations induce limited errors. In order to show the usefulness of the presented theoretical developments, the approach is applied to chained-form systems and, for illustration, simulations results are given for the robust stabilization of a unicycle.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an approach for decentralized real-time motion planning for multiple mobile robots operating in a common 2D environment with unknown stationary obstacles. In our model, a robot can see (sense) the surrounding objects. It knows its current and its target's position, is able to distinguish a robot from an obstacle, and can assess the instantaneous motion of another robot. Other than this, a robot has no knowledge about the scene or of the paths and objectives of other robots. There is no mutual communication among the robots; no constraints are imposed on the paths or shapes of robots and obstacles. Each robot plans its path toward its target dynamically, based on its current position and the sensory feedback; only the translation component is considered for the planning purposes. With this model, the suggested strategy is based on maze-searching techniques. Computer simulation results are provided that demonstrate good performance and robustness of the algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies motion planning from one zero velocity state to another for a three-joint robot in a horizontal plane with a passive revolute third joint. Such a robot is small-time locally controllable on an open subset of its zero velocity section, allowing it to follow any path in this subset arbitrarily closely. However, some paths are ``preferred'' by the dynamics of the manipulator in that they can be followed at higher speeds. In this paper we describe a computationally efficient trajectory planner which finds fast collision-free trajectories among obstacles. We are able to decouple the problem of planning feasible trajectories in the robot's six-dimensional state space into the computationally simpler problems of planning paths in the three-dimensional configuration space and time scaling the paths according to the manipulator dynamics. This decoupling is made possible by the existence of velocity directions, fixed in the passive link frame, which can be executed at arbitrary speeds. We have demonstrated the motion planner on an experimental underactuated manipulator. To our knowledge, it is the first implementation of a collision-free motion planning algorithm for a manipulator subject to a second-order nonholonomic constraint.},

This permitted to emphasize the role of different vibrational mechanisms in the formation of the average flows. It is shown that an appropriate combination of these mechanisms can be used to counteract the usual convective flows (buoyancy-and/or thermocapillary-driven) inherent to crystal growth processes from the liquid phase. While vibrational convection is rather complex due to these identified mechanisms, the new modeling used in the present paper opens up very promising perspectives to efficiently control heat and mass transfer during real industrial applications of crystal growth from the liquid phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past few years, important results have been obtained on time-varying feedback stabilization for strongly nonlinear systems. Research on this topic was motivated primarily by control problems for non-holonomic driftless mechanical systems-such as mobile robots. In this paper, we present results on exponential stabilization by time-varying homogeneous feedback, and investigate their applications to control systems with drift. Two general methods, originally developed for driftless systems, are presented. The first method relies on scaling asymptotically stabilizing feedback into exponential stabilizing feedback via a dilation. The second method applies a time-averaging technique to simplify the stability analysis of the closed-loop homogeneous system. These methods are demonstrated on two challenging stabilization problems: the planar rigid body with two forces and the spatial rigid body with one force and two torques. (44 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an algorithm and implementation for efficient inverse kinematics for a general six-revolute (6R) manipulator. When stated mathematically, the problem reduces to solving a system of multivariate equations. We make use of the algebraic properties of the system and the symbolic formulation used for reducing the problem to solving a univariate polynomial. However, the polynomial is expressed as a matrix determinant and its roots are computed by reducing to an eigenvalue problem. The other roots of the multivariate system are obtained by computing eigenvectors and substitution. The algorithm involves symbolic preprocessing, matrix computations and a variety of other numerical techniques. The average running time of the algorithm, for most cases, is 11 milliseconds on an IBM RS/6000 workstation. This approach is applicable to inverse kinematics of all serial manipulators.

The nonholonomy of such systems can be exploited in practical devices, which is very useful in robotic applications. In order to achieve all potential benefits, a deeper understanding of these types of systems and more practical algorithms for planning and controlling their motions are necessary. In this paper, we study the controllability aspect of this problem, giving a complete description of the reachable manifold for general pairs of bodies, and a constructive controllability algorithm for planning rolling motions for dexterous robot hands.},

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the so-called "bugs" problem from mathematics, we study the geometric formations of multi-vehicle systems under cyclic pursuit. First, we introduce the notion of cyclic pursuit by examining a system of identical linear agents in the plane. This idea is then extended to a system of wheeled vehicles, each subject to a single nonholonomic constraint (i.e., unicycles), which is the principal focus of this article. The pursuit framework is particularly simple in that the n identical vehicles are ordered such that vehicle i pursues vehicle i + 1 modulo n. In this article, we assume each vehicle has the same constant forward speed. We show that the system's equilibrium formations are generalized regular polygons and it is exposed how the multi-vehicle system's global behavior can be shaped through appropriate controller gain assignments. We then study the local stability of these equilibrium polygons, revealing which formations are stable and which are not. Index Terms: Cooperative control, multi-agent systems, circulant matrices, pursuit problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the author's recent research in robotic manipulation and speculates on potentially fruitful directions for future work. The work is focused on nonprehensile manipulation: manipulating objects without grasping them. In particular, the paper surveys work on: a single joint robot that orients parts on a conveyor belt; a robot that uses dynamics to snatch, roll, or throw objects; hitting things to position them; manipulating things whose shapes are not completely known; and integration of manipulation with locomotion. In the future, a broad view of robotics will allow us to focus on fundamental principles and at the same time address a variety of new applications. (45 References).},

The proposed concept of navigation control along with the tools necessary for its construction achieve this goal. The most significant tool is the artificial vector potential field which shows a better ability to steer motion than does a scalar potential field. The synthesis procedure emphasizes flexibility so that the effort needed to modify the control is commensurate with the change in the geometry of the workspace. Theoretical development along with simulation results are provided. (84 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to path planning, called the Ariadne's clew algorithm. It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments-ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called SEARCH and EXPLORE, applied in an interleaved manner. EXPLORE builds a representation of the accessible space while SEARCH looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is found in about one second without any pre-processing. (29 References).},

Once started on a shallow slope, a machine of this class will settle into a steady gait quite comparable to human walking, without active control or energy input. Interpretation and analysis of the physics are straightforward; the walking cycle, its stability, and its sensitivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experiments with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

Previous work has shown that the motion problem can be decoupled into trajectory generation and steering. We investigate basic issues of momentum generation for a class of dynamic mobile robots, focusing on eel-like swimming robots. We use control laws based on a series of gaits motivated by the biological literature on coupled oscillators and central pattern generators. A primary characteristic of this class of robots is that drift plays a significant role in the generation of motion. We develop theoretical justification for a forward gait that has been observed in nature and for a turning gait, used in our control laws, that has not yet been studied in the biological literature. We also explore theoretical predictions of novel gaits for turning and sideways swimming. (14 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we approach the modeling, simulation, and control of snake and eel-like robots from a geometric perspective. We propose basic viscous and fluid drag models to capture the effect of external forces acting on the bodies of land-based snakes and aquatic eels, respectively. Using these models, we show that the dynamics can be decomposed into motions in the position and orientation of the overall system and changes in its internal shape. This allows us to write reduced dynamics for the serpentine and swimming motions that isolate the effect of shape changes on the momentum of the system. We explore in simulation several types of locomotive gaits, and report qualitative experimental results that provide validation for these simulations. (17 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The principle of vibrational control is presented. This principle consists in the introduction of such vibrations (with zero mean value) of the dynamic system parameters which modify the properties of the system in a desired manner. Unlike conventional control principles, vibrational control does not require measurements of deviations and disturbances. Classes of dynamic systems are described where the vibrational control is effective for ensuring:. 1) the stability, 2) the desired properties of the transient motions, and 3) the desired properties of the dynamic system response to the external disturbance. Applications of the vibrational control are also considered which include method of alternating-gradient focusing in particle accelerators and vibrational stabilization of glow discharge in powerful continuous gas lasers. Vibrational control principle seems to be useful in cases where feedback and feedforward principles cannot be applied.},

The $p$-median problem is to minimize the sum of distances from demand points to their respective nearest supply points. We prove that the $p$-center and the $p$-median problems relative to both the Euclidean and the rectilinear metrics are NP-hard. In fact, we prove that it is NP-hard even to approximate the $p$-center problems sufficiently closely. The reductions are from 3-satisfiability.},

From an original idea by Yakubovich (1967), the approach has been developed under a combination of influences from the Western and Russian traditions of control theory. It is shown how a complex system can be described, using integral quadratic constraints (IQC) for its elementary components. A stability theorem for systems described by IQCs is presented that covers classical passivity/dissipativity arguments but simplifies the use of multipliers and the treatment of causality. A systematic computational approach is described, and relations to other methods of stability analysis are discussed. Last, but not least, the paper contains a summarizing list of IQCs for important types of system components. (55 References).},

This dynamic graph structure provides a convenient framework for modeling distributed dynamic systems where the topology of the interaction among its elements evolves in time. The static theory of graphs has been an active area of research in non-enumerative combinatorics. In this paper, we propose a framework for studying dynamic graphs as an area that lies at the intersection of dynamical systems and combinatorics. We also highlight the directions which we find to be particularly promising in this venue.},

Various methodologies have been considered for formation control of multiple spacecraft, each offering different degrees of generality and flexibility. One popular framework is known as leader following (LF). Several results in the LF framework for the formation flying control are presented. In this direction, ideas from elementary graph theory and linear matrix inequalities are combined with logic-based switching to shed light on the class of control designs that are feasible through LF for a representative set of formation flying scenarios.},

A set G of points (the guards) in a simple closed polygon (the art gallery) is a guarded guard set provided (i) every point in the polygon is visible to some point in G; and (ii) every point in G is visible to some other point in G. We prove that a polygon with n sides always has a guarded guard set of cardinality floor(3n - 1)/7 and that this bound is sharp (n geq 5); our result corrects an erroneous formula in the literature. We also use a coloring argument to give an entirely new proof that the corresponding sharp function for orthogonal polygons is floor n/3 for n geq 6; this result was originally established by induction by Hernandez-Penalver.},

  Abstract                 = {Deals with a task-assignment architecture for cooperative transport by multiple mobile robots in unknown environment. A group of mobile robots that works in a coordinated manner has potential to be a flexible material handling system because of their ability to take a free formation. So far, the focus of research on this topic has been on control problems. The final goal of cooperative transportation is to handle a given object until it achieves a given configuration. However, in places such as construction sites and distribution centers, robots will share their work space with other robot groups or humans. That means that not all of the environmental information can be acquired a priori. Therefore, it is necessary for robots to satisfy various requirements besides handling an object. We call these various requirements tasks and focus on a task-assignment architecture. The authors propose the following approach. (a) We consider the unit of task (task instance) as the form that should be done in a short time by one robot. (b) The priority of each task instance is evaluated dynamically based on the number of robots and the configuration in the work space. Then a task-assignment problem for the short term is formulated, which we call the assignment problem, which can be solved in real-time by using a linear programming method. A robots' behavior is planned by iterating the following every constant sampling time. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is verified by a cooperative transport simulation and also by an experiment using two omni-directional robots in an unknown environment.

  Abstract                 = {A supervisor synthesis technique for Petri net plants with uncontrollable and unobservable transitions, that enforces the conjunction of a set of linear inequalities on the reachable markings of the plant, is presented. The approach is based on the concept of Petri net place invariants. Each step of the procedure is illustrated through a running example involving the supervision of a robotic assembly cell. The controller is described by an auxiliary Petri net connected to the plant's transitions, providing a unified Petri net model of the closed-loop system. The synthesis technique is based on the concept of admissible constraints. Procedures are given for identifying all admissible linear constraints for a plant with uncontrollable and unobservable transitions, as well as methods for transforming inadmissible constraints into admissible ones. A technique is described for creating a modified Petri net controller that enforces the union of all of these control laws. The method is practical and computationally inexpensive in terms of size, design time, and implementation complexity.},

Various applications are discussed and simulations are included to illustrate convergence dynamics as well as to measure practical performance as a function of problem parameters.},

Theories describing the operation of such systems have been developed and applied, especially in the study of robotics. Not surprisingly, the inclusion of dynamical effects adds complexity and changes some of the qualitative properties. In this paper we give a complete analysis of the optimal positioning problem for a natural class of dynamical systems whose inertial effects are linear but whose kinematics are those of the standard nonholonomic integrator. Based on these results we develop a suitable modification of the approximate inverse method for solving tracking and stabilization problems. (16 References).},

It provides time-varying homogeneous feedback laws that are continuous and smooth away from the origin. These feedback laws make the closed-loop system globally, exponentially and asymptotically stable if the control system is homogeneous with respect to a family of dilations and, using local homogeneous approximation of control systems, locally, exponentially and asymptotically stable otherwise. The method uses some known algorithms that construct oscillatory control inputs to approximate motion in the direction of iterated Lie brackets that we adapt to the closed-loop context.

The approach is based on the concept of bounded transverse functions, the existence of which is equivalent to the system's controllability. Its outcome is the practical stabilization of any trajectory, i.e., not necessarily a solution of the control system, in the state-space. The possibility of applying the approach to an arbitrary controllable smooth driftless system follows in turn from the fact that any controllable homogeneous approximation of this system can be lifted (via a dynamic extension) to a system on a Lie group.

Since the natural geometric background is a Riemannian manifold, we begin by generalizing La Salle theorems about the stability of equilibrium points of dynamical systems to a complete Riemannian manifold. The stability of dissipative mechanical systems is studied using the particular geometric properties of the tangent bundle, and passivity based controls are designed to stabilize equilibrium points. The case of partially dissipative systems is formulated and used with a dynamical extension to design controls for bringing the system to a desired point of the phase space.},

  Abstract                 = {An active sensing method for multisensor fusion systems with actuators is proposed. To realize active sensing with multiple sensors: (i) where to position sensors; (ii) how to associate data; and (iii) how to fuse data should be determined. The authors propose a new method mainly concerning (i). The method utilizes estimated errors of estimates to determine optimal sensor locations where useful data are expected to be obtained and effectively associated. As examples, the active sensing method is applied to multitarget tracking by a system with two hand-eye cameras, and visual and tactile fusion in a system with a camera and a tactile sensor. By using this method, the sensing strategy is optimized for the object of measurement},

  Abstract                 = {To perform visual search, humans, like many mammals, encode a large field of view with retinas having variable spatial resolution, and then use high-speed eye movements to direct the highest resolution region, the fovea, towards potential target locations. Good search performance is essential for survival, and hence mammals may have evolved efficient strategies for selecting fixation locations. Here we address two questions: what are the optimal eye movement strategies for a foveated visual system faced with the problem of finding a target in a cluttered environment, and do humans employ optimal eye movement strategies during a search? We derive the ideal bayesian observer for search tasks in which a target is embedded at an unknown location within a random background that has the spectral characteristics of natural scenes. Our ideal searcher uses precise knowledge about the statistics of the scenes in which the target is embedded, and about its own visual system, to make eye movements that gain the most information about target location. We find that humans achieve nearly optimal search performance, even though humans integrate information poorly across fixations. Analysis of the ideal searcher reveals that there is little benefit from perfect integration across fixations much more important is efficient processing of information on each fixation. Apparently, evolution has exploited this fact to achieve efficient eye movement strategies with minimal neural resources devoted to memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonholonomic constraints are exploited to design a controllable n-joint manipulator with only two inputs. Gears subject to nonholonomic constraints are designed to transmit velocities from the inputs to the passive joints. The system possesses a triangular structure for which a conversion into chained form is presented. The nonholonomic manipulator can, therefore, be controlled with an open loop or a closed loop using existing controllers for chained form. Mechanical design is established, and experimental results proved the usefulness of design of the nonholonomic manipulator and applied control schemes. While previous publications have assumed that the nonholonomic systems are given and have developed theory for these systems, this paper points out a new direction where the nonholonomic theory is used to design controllable and stabilizable systems.

  Abstract                 = {The nonlinear motion of underactuated mechanisms has drawn recent interests of researchers. Underactuated mechanical systems are often subject to so-called nonholonomic constraints which are related to many both theoretical and practical issues. We first analyze the nonlinear behavior of a two-joint planar manipulator with the second joint free, from nonlinear dynamics point of view. We then discuss the simultaneous positioning of both joints. We use a time-periodic input and propose an amplitude modulation of the feedback error. The analysis via the Poincare map shows that the behavior becomes chaotic with large amplitude. The effectiveness of the proposed positioning control is verified by experiments. (31 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for the numerical solution of the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman PDE that arises in an infinite time optimal control problem. The method can be of higher order to reduce "the curse of dimensionality". It proceeds in two stages. First the HJB PDE is solved in a neighborhood of the origin using the power series method of Al'brecht. From a boundary point of this neighborhood, an extremal trajectory is computed backward in time using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Then ordinary differential equations are developed for the higher partial derivatives of the solution along the extremal. These are solved yielding a power series for the approximate solution in a neighborhood of the extremal. This is repeated for other extremals and these approximate solutions are fitted together by transferring them to a rectangular grid using splines.},

Properties of configuration space transformations are presented in general, and these properties are invoked in algorithms that result in highly efficient computations. The approach depends on the definition of a set of primitives, which are themselves efficiently transformed and may be combined logically to construct more complex transformations. The concepts are illustrated with both computed and empirically obtained configuration space obstacles in two and three dimensions. Performance data for real-time transformations are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {A study is made of how the existence of transmission time delays affects the application of advanced robot control schemes to effective force-reflecting telerobotic systems. This application best exploits the presence of the human operator while making full use of available robot control technology and computing power. A physically motivated, passivity-based formalism is used to provide energy conservation and stability guarantees in the presence of transmission delays. The notion of wave variable is utilized to characterize time-delay systems and leads to a configuration for force-reflecting teleoperation. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated experimentally. Within the same framework, an adaptive tracking controller is incorporated for the control of the remote robotic system and can be used to simplify, transform, or enhance the remote dynamics perceived by the operator},

  Abstract                 = {Snap-through instabilities occur in the dynamics of several classes of electromechanical systems which are of interest in connection with a number of actuator technologies. We describe two types of electromechanical devices (electrostatic and electromagnetic) for which snap-through instabilities occur, and we propose and analyze a novel open-loop oscillatory control design for stabilizing the operation of a prototype electromagnetic system (which we call the two-wire system) inside the snap-through instability region. We argue that this design has several advantages over competing feedback designs in terms of implementation cost and robustness. Our approach involves averaging theory and the design of an averaged potential function around whose critical points the dynamics of the controlled system is organized. A globally stabilizing control law is designed by parametrically shaping the averaged potential. Practical features of the control law are discussed, and the performance of the controlled system is shown to be robust with respect to a class of disturbances.},

The tool box consists of 35 nearest neighbourhood operations based upon twelve generalized Voronoi diagrams: the order-k Voronoi diagram, the ordered order-k Voronoi diagram, the farthest-point Voronoi diagram, the kth-nearest-point Voronoi diagram, the weighted Voronoi diagram, the line Voronoi diagram, the area Voronoi diagram, the Manhattan Voronoi diagram, the spherical Voronoi diagram, the Voronoi diagram in a river, the polyhedral Voronoi diagram, and the network Voronoi diagram. Each operation is illustrated with examples and the literature of computational methods. (63 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called $\alpha$-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or alpha-agents, and virtual agents associated with alpha-agents called beta- and gamma-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., "flocks need no leaders. "A "universal" definition of flocking for particle systems with similarities to Lyapunov stability is given. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate performing 2-D and 3-D flocking, split/rejoin maneuver, and squeezing maneuver for hundreds of agents using the proposed algorithms.},

We consider the cases of networks with communication time-delays and channels that have filtering effects. We find a tight upper bound on the maximum fixed time-delay that can be tolerated in the network. It turns out that the connectivity of the network is the key in reaching a consensus. The case of agreement with bounded inputs is considered by analyzing the convergence of a class of nonlinear protocols. A Lyapuvov function is introduced that qualifies the total disagreement among the nodes of a network. Simulation results are provided for agreement in networks with communication time-delays and constrained inputs.},

The notion of graph rigidity is crucial in identifying the shape variables of a formation. This eventually leads to tools for formation stabilization, tacking, and formal representation of split, rejoin, and reconfiguration maneuvers for multi-vehicle formations. We introduce an algebra that consists of performing some basic operations on graphs which allow creation of larger rigid-by-construction graphs by combining smaller rigid subgraphs. This is particularly useful in performing and representing rejoin/split maneuvers of multiple formations in a distributed fashion.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT FOR RELATED PAPER: Abstract. A practical way for obtaining depth in computer vision is the use of structured light systems. For panoramic depth reconstruction several images are needed which most likely implies the construction of a sensor with mobile elements. Moreover, misalignments can appear for non-static scenes. Omnidirectional cameras offer a much wider field of view than the perspective ones, capture a panoramic image at every moment and alleviate the problems due to occlusions. This paper is focused on the idea of combining omnidirectional vision and structured light with the aim to obtain panoramic depth information. The resulting sensor is formed by a single catadioptric camera and an omnidirectional light projector.},

While the unactuated joints dynamic equation is recognized to be a nonholonomic constraint in the general case, necessary and sufficient conditions are given to identify special cases in which such a constraint is integrable. In contrast to most examples in the literature, the unactuated joints dynamics is an instance of a second-order nonholonomic constraint. it is shown that smooth feedback stabilization to a single equilibrium point is not possible, and a feedback scheme providing stabilization to a manifold of equilibrium positions is proposed.

  Abstract                 = {Passivity-based control (PBC) has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. The application of PBC in regulation problems of mechanical systems yields controllers that have a clear physical interpretation in terms of interconnection of the system with its environment. In particular, the total energy of the closed-loop is the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Furthermore, since the EL structure is preserved in closed-loop, PBC is robust vis a vis unmodeled dissipative effects. Unfortunately, these nice properties are sometimes lost when PBC is used in other applications, for instance, in electrical and electromechanical systems. In this paper we further contribute to develop a new PBC theory encompassing a broader class of systems, and preserving the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance, continuing upon our previous work. Towards this end we consider port-controlled Hamiltonian systems with dissipation (PCHD), which result from the network modeling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models.

Although, in theory, this process is observable even without an observer maneuver, estimation performance (i.e., accuracy, stability and convergence rate) can be greatly enhanced by properly exploiting observer motion to increase observability. This work addresses the optimization of observer trajectories for bearings-only fixed-target localization. The approach presented herein is based on maximizing the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), subject to state constraints imposed on the observer trajectory (e.g., by the target defense system). Direct optimal control numerical schemes, including the recently introduced differential inclusion (DI) method, are used to solve the resulting optimal control problem. Computer simulations, utilizing the familiar Stansfield and maximum likelihood (ML) estimators, demonstrate the enhancement to target position estimability using the optimal observer trajectories.

The resulting model turns out to be a Chaplygin system, which allows the dynamics equations and the kinematic constraints to be integrated separately. The system is driven by six actuators: one actuator connected to one roller of each wheel, and three more actuators controlling the orientation of the ball-carriers with respect to the platform. Analysis of the mathematical model of this system using the holonomy matrix yields conditions under which the system can be rendered holonomic. Holonomy can be achieved by keeping the ball-carriers in pure translational motion. Therefore, the control of the system can be simplified by imposing constraints on the ball-carriers that prevent them from changing their orientation with respect to an inertial frame.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper derives controllability tests for a large class of mechanical systems characterized by nonholonomic constraints and symmetries. Recent research in geometric mechanics has led to a single, simplified framework that describes this class of systems, which includes examples such as: wheeled mobile robots; undulatory robotic and biological locomotion systems, such as paramecia, inchworms, and snakes; and the reorientation of satellites and underwater vehicles. This geometric framework has also been applied to more unusual examples, such as the snakeboard robot, the wobblestone, and the reorientation of a falling cat. Using results from modern nonlinear control theory, we develop accessibility and controllability tests based on this reduced geometric structure. We also discuss parallels between these tests and the construction of open-loop control algorithms, with analogies to the generation of locomotive gaits for robotic systems. (28 References).},

We study optimal gaits for the snakeboard, a representative example of this class of systems. We employ Lagrangian reduction techniques to simplify the optimal control problem, and describe a general framework and an algorithm to obtain numerical solutions to this problem. This paper represents an initial study in using optimal control techniques to study optimality of gaits and issues involving gait transitions. The general framework provided in this paper can easily be applied to other examples of biological and robotic locomotion},

  Abstract                 = {A linear finite-dimensional plant with rational state-space parameter dependence is controlled using a parameter-dependent controller. The parameters are known to take on values in a unit ball, and are known in real time. The goal of control is to stabilize the parameter-dependent closed-loop system, and provide disturbance/error attenuation as measured in induced L/sub 2/ norms. The approach taken uses the optimally scaled small-gain theorem, and solves the control synthesis problem by reformulating the existence conditions into a finite-dimensional convex optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {Describes a globally stable tracking controller for robot manipulators. The controller is an extension of Takegaki and Arimoto's (1981) position controller to the tracking case where a theorem of Matrosov is used to prove its stability. An attractive features of this controller is its resemblance to the computed torque controller with the inertia matrix outside the position and velocity feedback loops. Thus the authors' controller is decomposed into an inner PD loop and an outer dynamic compensation loop. This structure allows the simple PD computations to be run at a higher speed than the dynamic compensation loop in digital implementations. (12 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We define a notion of mesh stability for a class of interconnected nonlinear systems. Intuitively, mesh stability is the property of damping disturbance propagation. We derive a set of sufficient conditions to assure mesh stability of "look-ahead" interconnected systems. Mesh stability is shown to be robust with respect to structural and singular perturbations. The theory is applied to an example of formation flying.},

  Abstract                 = {Large scale control systems typically possess a hierarchical architecture in order to manage complexity. Higher levels of the hierarchy utilize coarser models of the system resulting by aggregating the detailed lower level models. In this layered control paradigm, the notion of hierarchical consistency is important as it ensures the implementation of high level objectives by the lower level system. In this paper, we define a notion of modeling hierarchy for continuous control systems and obtain characterizations for hierarchically consistent linear systems with respect to controllability objectives. As an interesting byproduct, we obtain a hierarchical controllability criterion for linear systems from which we recover the best of the known controllability algorithms from numerical linear algebra.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have witnessed great advancements in the sciences and technology of autonomy, robotics and networking. This dissertation develops concepts and algorithms for dynamic vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal multi-vehicle routes to provide service to demands (or more generally to perform tasks) that are generated over time by an exogenous process. We consider a rich variety of scenarios relevant for robotic applications. We begin by reviewing some of the approaches available to tackle DVR problems. Next, we study different multi-vehicle scenarios based on different models for demands (in particular, demands with time constraints, demands with different priority levels, and demands that must be transported from a pick-up to a delivery location). The performance criterion used in these scenarios is either the expected waiting time of the demands or the fraction of demands serviced successfully. In each specific DVR scenario we adopt a rigorous technical approach, which we call algorithmic queueing theory and which relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic geometry. Algorithmic queueing theory consists of three basics steps: 1) queueing model of the DVR problem and analysis of its structure; 2) establishment of fundamental limitations on performance, independent of algorithms; and 3) design of algorithms that are either optimal or constant-factor away from optimal. In the second part of the dissertation, we address problems concerning the implementation of routing policies in large-scale robotic networks, such as adaptivity and decentralized computation. We first present distributed algorithms for environment partitioning, and then we apply them to devise routing policies for DVR problems that (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to network changes, and (ii) have remarkably good performance guarantees. The technical approach developed in this dissertation is applicable to a wide variety of DVR problems: several possible extensions are discussed throughout the thesis.},

  Abstract                 = {A control system based on the principles used by cockroaches to climb obstacles is introduced and applied to a bio-inspired hexapod robot. Cockroaches adaptively use different strategies as functions of the ground morphology and obstacle characteristics. The control system introduced in this paper consists of two parts working in parallel. Locomotion control is performed by a cellular neural network (CNN) playing the role of an artificial central pattern generator (CPG) for the robot, while a new attitude control system has been designed. In order to reproduce the adaptative capabilities of the biological model, the attitude control system is based on a motor map and is aimed at regulating the posture of the robot to allow it to overcome obstacles. In fact, high obstacles require the locomotion gait to be reorganized by changing the posture of the robot to be more effective during the overcoming of the obstacle. Both proprioceptive and exteroceptive information are needed to solve this problem, they constitute the input of the adaptive attitude control. Simulation results illustrating the suitability of the control system are also shown.},

  Abstract                 = {A widely applied strategy for workload sharing is to equalize the workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multiagent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies whereby: 1) the environment is equitably divided into subregions of equal measure; 2) one agent is assigned to each subregion; and 3) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. The current lack of distributed algorithms for the computation of equitable partitions limits the applicability of equitable partitioning policies to limited-size multiagent systems operating in known, static environments. In this paper, first we design provably correct and spatially distributed algorithms that allow a team of agents to compute a convex and equitable partition of a convex environment. Second, we discuss how these algorithms can be extended so that a team of agents can compute, in a spatially distributed fashion, convex and equitable partitions with additional features, e.g., equitable and median Voronoi diagrams. Finally, we discuss two application domains for our algorithms, namely dynamic vehicle routing for mobile robotic networks and wireless ad hoc networks. Through these examples, we show how one can couple the algorithms presented in this paper with equitable partitioning policies to make these amenable to distributed implementation. More in general, we illustrate a systematic approach to devise spatially distributed control policies for a large variety of multiagent coordination problems. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm and exploits the unique features of power diagrams.},

  Abstract                 = {The most widely applied resource allocation strategy is to balance, or equalize, the total workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multi-agent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies in which (i) the workspace is divided into subregions of equal measure, (ii) there is a bijective correspondence between agents and subregions, and (iii) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. In this paper, we provide the first distributed algorithm that provably allows m agents to converge to an equitable partition of the workspace, from any initial configuration, i.e., globally. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm, and provides novel insights into the properties of power diagrams. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we study the problem of designing motion strategies for a team of mobile agents, required to fulfill request for on-site service in a given planar region. In our model, each service request is generated by a spatio-temporal stochastic process; once a service request has been generated, it remains active for a certain deterministic amount of time, and then expires. An active service request is fulfilled when one of the mobile agents visits the location of the request. Specific problems we investigate are the following: what is the minimum number of mobile agents needed to ensure that a certain fraction of service requests is fulfilled before expiration? What strategy should they use to ensure that this objective is attained? This problem can be viewed as the stochastic and dynamic version of the well-known vehicle routing problem with time windows. We also extend our analysis to the case in which the time service requests remain active is itself a random variable, describing customer impatience. The customers' impatience is only known to the mobile agents via prior statistics. In this case, it is desired to minimize the fraction of service requests missed because of impatience. Finally, we show how the routing strategies presented in the paper can be executed in a distributed fashion.},

They would be capable of 1) long excursions (by hopping), 2) short traverses to specific locations (through a sequence of controlled tumbles), and 3) high-altitude, attitude-controlled ballistic flight (akin to spacecraft flight). Their control would rely on synergistic operations with the mother spacecraft (where most of hybrids' perception and localization functionalities would be hosted), which would make the platforms minimalistic and, in turn, the entire mission architecture affordable. The Phase I study was aimed at providing an initial feasibility assessment of the proposed architecture and had, in particular, four main objectives: 1) to characterize the expected science return of spatially-extended in-situ exploration at small Solar System bodies, 2) to demonstrate that a hybrid can achieve both large surface coverage via hopping and fine mobility via tumbling in low gravity environments (specifically, for a boulder-free environment with a gravity level on the order of mm/s^2, the requirement was 20\%-30\% motion accuracy with an average speed on the order of cm/s); 3) to provide first-order estimates for the critical subsystems, and 4) to study mission operations and a mission scenario to Phobos.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a mission architecture for the systematic and affordable in-situ exploration of small Solar System bodies (such as asteroids, comets, and Martian moons). At a general level, a mother spacecraft would deploy on the surface of a small body one, or several, spacecraft/rover hybrids, which are small (<= 5 kg, ~15 Watts), multi-faceted robots enclosing three mutually orthogonal flywheels and surrounded by external spikes (in particular, there is no external propulsion). By accelerating/decelerating the flywheels and by exploiting the low gravity environment, the hybrids would be capable of performing both long excursions (by hopping) and short traverses to specific locations (through a sequence of controlled "tumbles"). Their control would rely on synergistic operations with the mother spacecraft (where most of hybrids perception and localization functionalities would be hosted), which would make the platforms minimalistic and in turn the entire mission architecture affordable. Specifically, in the first part of the paper we present preliminary models and laboratory experiments for the hybrids, first-order estimates for critical subsystems, and a preliminary study for synergistic mission operations. In the second part, we tailor our mission architecture to the exploration of Mars' moon Phobos. The mission aims at exploring Phobos' Stickney crater, whose spectral similarities with C-type asteroids and variety of terrain properties make it a particularly interesting exploration target to address both high-priority science for the Martian system and strategic knowledge gaps for the future human exploration of Mars.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present adaptive and distributed algorithms for motion coordination of a group of m vehicles. The vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, spatial location, and service requirement are stochastic; the objective is to minimize the average time demands spend in the system. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment. In this paper, we first devise new control policies for the 1-DTRP that: i) are provably optimal both in light-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is small) and in heavy-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is large), and ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against changes in load conditions. Then, we show that specific partitioning policies, whereby the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a certain set of rules within its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions. Building upon the previous results, we finally design control policies for the m-DTRP that i) are adaptive and distributed, and ii) have strong performance guarantees in heavy-load conditions and stabilize the system in any load condition.},

  Abstract                 = {The most widely applied resource allocation strategy is to balance, or equalize, the total workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multi-agent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies in which (i) the workspace is divided into subregions of equal measure, (ii) each agent is assigned to a unique subregion, and (iii) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. In this paper, we design distributed and adaptive policies to allow a team of agents to achieve a convex and equitable partition of a convex workspace. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm, and exploits the unique features of Power Diagrams. We discuss possible applications to routing of vehicles in stochastic and dynamic environments, and to wireless networks. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},

The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized, a-priori task assignment, and are therefore of limited applicability in scenarios involving large ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles. By combining results from geometric probability and locational optimization, we provide a policy that solves, providing a constant-factor approximation to the optimal achievable performance, the decentralized version of the m-DTRP; such policy (i) does not rely on centralized and a priori task assignment, (ii) is spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to network changes.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are multiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive in the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site service that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its performance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy performs within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal), where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service times, and the convex combination coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we develop methods for maximizing the throughput of a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system. We consider a finite group of shared vehicles, located at a set of stations. Users arrive at the stations, pick-up vehicles, and drive (or are driven) to their destination station where they drop-off the vehicle. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, the system will inevitably become out of balance: Vehicles will build up at some stations, and become depleted at others. We propose a robotic solution to this rebalancing problem that involves empty robotic vehicles autonomously driving between stations. We develop a rebalancing policy that minimizes the number of vehicles performing rebalancing trips. To do this, we utilize a fluid model for the customers and vehicles in the system. The model takes the form of a set of nonlinear time-delay differential equations. We then show that the optimal rebalancing policy can be found as the solution to a linear program. By analyzing the dynamical system model, we show that every station reaches an equilibrium in which there are excess vehicles and no waiting customers. We use this solution to develop a real-time rebalancing policy which can operate in highly variable environments. We verify policy performance in a simulated mobility-on-demand environment with stochastic features found in real-world urban transportation networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Transportation-On-Demand (TOD) systems, where users generate requests for transportation from a pick-up point to a delivery point, are already very popular and are expected to increase in usage dramatically as the inconvenience of privately-owned cars in metropolitan areas becomes excessive. Routing service vehicles through customers is usually accomplished with heuristic algorithms. In this paper we study TOD systems in a formal setting that allows us to characterize fundamental performance limits and devise dynamic routing policies with provable performance guarantees. Specifically, we study TOD systems in the form of a unit-capacity, multiple-vehicle dynamic pick-up and delivery problem, whereby pick-up requests arrive according to a Poisson process and are randomly located according to a general probability density. Corresponding delivery locations are also randomly distributed according to a general probability density, and a number of unit-capacity vehicles must transport demands from their pick-up locations to their delivery locations. We derive insightful fundamental bounds on the steady-state waiting times for the demands, and we devise constant-factor optimal dynamic routing policies.

  Abstract                 = {We consider complete state tracking feedback control of a ship having two controls, namely surge force and yaw moment. The ship model has similarities with chained form systems but cannot directly be transformed in chained form. In particular, the model has a drift vector field as opposed to the drift-free chained form systems. It is shown here that methods developed for tracking control of chained form systems still can be used for developing a tracking control law for the ship. Through a coordinate transformation the model is put in a triangular-like form which makes it possible to use integrator backstepping to develop a tracking control law. The control law steers both the position variables and the course angle of the ship, providing exponential stability of the reference trajectory. Experimental results are presented where the control law is implemented for tracking control of a model of an offshore supply vessel, scale 1:70. In the experiments the ship converges exponentially to a neighbourhood of the reference trajectory, and stays close with errors depending on factors as unmodelled dynamics, parameter uncertainty, measurement noise, thruster saturation, waves, currents and position measurement failures.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most difficult problems in the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and in differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) is the development of methods for dealing with highly oscillatory systems. These types of systems arise, for example, in vehicle simulation when modelling the suspension system or tyres, in models for contact and impact, in flexible body simulation from vibrations in the structural model, in molecular dynamics, in orbital mechanics, and in circuit simulation. Standard numerical methods can require a huge number of time-steps to track the oscillations, and even with small stepsizes they can alter the dynamics, unless the method is chosen very carefully. This paper will deal mainly with numerical methods for oscillating systems. (148 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The authors (see ibid., vol.43, no.1, p.243-53, 1995) have previously explored the use of novel concentration sensors for detecting and localizing vapor-emitting sources. We propose to replace stationary sensors by moving sensors, thus gaining the following two advantages. (1) A single moving sensor can accomplish the task of an array of stationary sensors by exploiting spatial and temporal diversity. (2) The sensor motion can be planned in real time to optimize localization performance},

  Abstract                 = {Future planetary explorations envisioned by the National Research Council's (NRC's) Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022, developed at the request of NASA the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Planetary Science Division (PSD), seek to reach targets of broad scientific interest across the solar system. This goal can be achieved by missions with next-generation capabilities such as innovative interplanetary trajectory solutions, highly accurate landings, the ability to be in close proximity to targets of interest, advanced pointing precision, multiple spacecraft in collaboration, multitarget tours, and advanced robotic surface exploration. Advancements in guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) and mission design-ranging from software and algorithm development to new sensors-will be necessary to enable these future missions. Spacecraft GN&C technologies have been evolving since the launch of the first rocket. Guidance is defined to be the onboard determination of the desired path of travel from the vehicle's current location to a designated target. Navigation is defined as the science behind transporting ships, aircraft, or spacecraft from place to place; particularly, the method of determining position, course, and distance traveled as well as the determination of the time reference. Control is defined as the onboard manipulation of vehicle steering controls to track guidance commands while maintaining vehicle pointing with the required precision. As missions become more complex, technological demands on GN&C increase, and so continuous technology progress is necessary. Recognizing the significance of this research, the NRC of the National Academies listed many GN&C technologies as top priorities in the recently released NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA's Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space. This document-Part III, Surface Guidance, Navigation, and Control-is the third, and last, in a series of technology assessments evaluating the capabilities and technologies needed for future missions pursuing SMD PSD's scientific goals. These reports cover the status of technologies and provide findings and recommendations to NASA PSD for future needs in GN&C and mission design technologies. Part I covers planetary mission design in general, as well as the estimation and control of vehicle flight paths when flight path and attitude dynamics may be treated as decoupled or only loosely coupled (as is the case the majority of the time in a typical planetary mission). Part II, Onboard Guidance, Navigation, and Control, covers attitude estimation and control in general, as well as the estimation and control of vehicle flight paths when flight path and attitude dynamics are strongly coupled (as is the case during certain critical phases, such as entry, descent, and landing, in some planetary missions). Part III, Surface Guidance, Navigation, and Control, examines GN&C for vehicles that are not in free flight, but that operate on or near the surface of a natural body of the solar system. It should be noted that this is the first time that Surface GNC has been assessed and requirements given for future missions. Together, these documents provide the PSD with a roadmap for achieving science missions in the next decade},

The design variables considered are the boundary perturbation and the spatial location of measurement sensors. The design criterion used is the determinant of Fisher's information matrix. It is shown that suitable choice of these variables leads to improved parameter accuracy. Two examples are used to illustrate this method. The first example is concerned with sensor location for estimating the velocity of propagation and the damping coefficient of a vibrating string. The second example is concerned with the estimation of the thermal diffusivity and radiation constant for a heat diffusion process. It is also shown that the design philosophy can be applied to a wide class of systems described by partial differential equations. (17 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of identification of objects being tracked by a fully decentralized surveillance system is considered. A decentralized multisensor system is used to track targets (people and mobile robots) as they enter and move around a factory assembly room performing tasks. The sensors used in this system (CCD cameras) reveal information about the targets that is sufficiently rich to allow them not only to be tracked, but also identified as a person, a robot, etc. This identity information can be used to aid in man-machine interface design and to facilitate situation assessment. After defining the identification problem, a centralized Bayesian algorithm is developed for determining the identity of each target based on each sensor's information. The algorithm is decentralized and its performance compared to the centralized version. Results of an implementation of the algorithm working on real data from the surveillance system are presented},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-vehicle systems are naturally encountered in civil and military applications. Cooperation amongst individual "miniaturized" vehicles allows for flexibility to accomplish missions that a single large vehicle may not readily be able to accomplish. While accomplishing a mission, motion planning algorithms are required to efficiently utilize a common resource (such as the total fuel in the collection of vehicles) or to penalize a collective cost function (such as to minimize the maximum time taken by the vehicles to reach their intended target). The objective of this paper is to present a constant factor approximation algorithm for planning the path of each vehicle in a collection of vehicles, where the motion of each vehicle must satisfy non-holonomic constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {A very large scale robotic (VLSR) system may consist of from hundreds to perhaps tens of thousands or more autonomous robots. The costs of robots are going down, and the robots are getting more compact, more capable, and more flexible. Hence, in the near future, we expect to see many industrial and military applications of VLSR systems. We define simple artificial force laws between pairs of robots or robot groups. The force laws are inverse-power force laws, incorporating both attraction and repulsion. The force laws can be distinct and to some degree they reflect the `social relations' among robots. Therefore we call our method social potential fields. An individual robot's motion is controlled by the resultant artificial force imposed by other robots and other components of the system. The approach is distributed in that the force calculations and motion control can be done in an asynchronous and distributed manner. We also extend the social potential fields model to use spring laws as force laws. The paper presents the first and a preliminary study on applying potential fields to distributed autonomous multi-robot control. We describe the generic framework of our social potential fields method. We show with computer simulations that the method can yield interesting and useful behaviors among robots, and we give examples of possible industrial and military applications. We also identify theoretical problems for future studies. (38 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an algorithm for the complete coverage of free space by a team of mobile robots. Our approach is based on a single robot coverage algorithm, which divides the target two-dimensional space into regions called cells, each of which can be covered with simple back-and-forth motions; the decomposition of free space in a collection of such cells is known as the Boustrophedon decomposition. Single robot coverage is achieved by ensuring that the robot visits every cell. The new multi-robot coverage algorithm uses the same planar cell-based decomposition as the single robot approach, but provides extensions to handle how teams of robots cover a single cell and how teams are allocated among cells. This method allows planning to occur in a two-dimensional configuration space for a team of N robots. The robots operate under the restriction that communication between two robots is available only when they are within line of sight of each other.},

  Abstract                 = {As a distributed solution to multi-agent coordination, consensus or agreement problems have been studied extensively in the literature. This paper provides a survey of consensus problems in multi-agent cooperative control with the goal of promoting research in this area. Theoretical results regarding consensus seeking under both time-invariant and dynamically changing information exchange topologies are summarized. Applications of consensus protocols to multiagent coordination are investigated. Future research directions and open problems are also proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology for exact robot motion planning and control that unifies the purely kinematic path planning problem with the lower level feedback controller design is presented. Complete information about a freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function, called a navigation function, that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all initial free configurations. A formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world is developed. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disk by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint disks representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation. Simulation results for planar scenarios are provided. (46 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The deterministic annealing approach to clustering and its extensions has demonstrated substantial performance improvement over standard supervised and unsupervised learning methods a variety of important applications including compression, estimation, pattern recognition and classification, and statistical regression. The method offers three important features: 1) the ability to avoid many poor local optima; 2) applicability to many different structures/architectures; and 3) the ability to minimize the right cost function even when its gradients vanish almost everywhere, as in the case of the empirical classification error. It derived within a probabilistic framework from basic information theoretic principles (e.g., maximum entropy and random coding). The application-specific cost is minimized subject to a constraint the randomness (Shannon entropy) of the solution, which is gradually lowered. We emphasize intuition gained from analogy statistical physics, where this is an annealing process that avoids many shallow local minima of the specified cost and, at the limit of zero temperature, produces a nonrandom (hard) solution. Alternatively, the method is derived within rate-distortion theory, where the annealing process is equivalent to computation Shannon s rate-distortion function, and the annealing temperature is inversely proportional to the slope of the curve. This provides new insights into the method and its performance, as well as new insights into rate-distortion theory itself. The basic algorithm is extended by incorporating structural constraints allow optimization of numerous popular structures including vector quantizers, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, and mixtures of experts. Experimental results show considerable performance gains over standard structure-specific and application-specific training methods. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of extensions of the method that are currently under investigation.},

The class of decision-making problems we consider encompasses a number of prototypical problems such as average-based consensus as well as distributed optimization, leader election, majority voting, MAX, MIN and evaluation of logical formulas. Specifically, we first propose a formal model that is based on the concept of I/O automata and is inspired by the Computer Science literature on distributed computing clusters. Then, we present a number of bounds on time, message, and byte complexity, which we use to investigate the relative performance of a number of algorithmic approaches for distributed decision-making. From a methodological standpoint, our work sheds light on the relation between the tools developed by the Computer Science and Controls communities on the topic of distributed computation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study the inherent trade-off between time and communication complexity for the distributed consensus problem. In our model, communication complexity is measured as the maximum data throughput (in bits per second) sent through the network at a given instant. Such a notion of communication complexity, referred to as bandwidth complexity, is related to the frequency bandwidth a designer should collectively allocate to the agents if they were to communicate via a wireless channel, which represents an important constraint for robotic networks. We prove a lower bound on the bandwidth complexity of the consensus problem and provide a matching consensus algorithm that is bandwidth-optimal for a wide class of consensus functions. We then propose a distributed algorithm that can trade communication complexity versus time complexity and robustness as a function of a tunable parameter, which can be adjusted by a system designer as a function of the properties of the wireless communication channel. We rigorously characterize the tunable algorithm's worst-case bandwidth complexity and show that it compares favorably with the bandwidth complexity of well-known consensus algorithms.},

We model the problem within a network flow framework and show that under relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing vehicles, if properly coordinated, do not lead to an increase in congestion (in stark contrast to common belief). From an algorithmic standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the problem of routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm for the autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the road. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of congestion-aware, system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and to the characterization of the sustainability of such robotic systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional attitude and shape control problems are studied for a class of spacecraft with articulated appendages and reaction wheels. A number of special cases of such attitude control problems have been studied previously. We provide a unified formulation and a comprehensive set of results for planning of attitude and shape maneuvers of a spacecraft, assuming that joint actuators and reaction wheels provide a sufficiently rich set of inputs. The development is based on a nonlinear, drift-free, control model that characterizes the attitude and shape change dynamics, assuming zero angular momentum of the system. Controllability results are presented for the general case, and specialized results are identified for interesting multibody spacecraft configurations. These results are made explicit by providing computable formulas for the Lie brackets in terms of the spacecraft geometry, mass properties, and shape. Constructive motion planning approaches are described to achieve spacecraft attitude and shape change maneuvers. A distinct feature of these approaches is that they require only simple computations, as is desirable for online implementation. Emphasis is given to the interplay between the shape change dynamics and the attitude change dynamics in achieving the maneuver planning objectives. (43 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We will study stability and asymptotic stability for time-varying systems described by ODE of the form x=f( epsilon /sup -1/t,x), where f(t,x) is 1-periodic with respect to t and epsilon [right angle bracket]0 is a small parameter. Since the discovery of stabilizing effect of vibration in the reverse pendulum example, there have been a lot of study regarding stability of such systems and design of fast-oscillating stabilizing feedback laws. In this paper we suggest an approach which is s kind of high-order averaging procedure based on Lie algebraic formalism and the formalism of chronological calculus. This latter is a method of asymptotic analysis for flows generated by time-variant ODE. We apply the approach to study stability issues for linear and nonlinear systems. In particular, we derive conditions of stability for the second- and third-order linear differential equations with periodic fast-oscillating coefficients, we study output-feedback stabilization of bilinear systems and consider high-order averaging procedure for nonlinear systems under homogeneity assumptions. At the end we study the problem of stabilization of nonholonomic (control-linear) systems by means of time-varying feedbacks. (22 References).},

We discuss how network modeling at such systems naturally leads to a geometrically defined class of systems, called port controlled Hamiltonian systems with dissipation (PCHD). The structural properties of these systems are investigated through geometric tools stemming from the theory of Hamiltonian systems. It is shown how the interconnection of the PCHD systems lead to another PCHD system, and how this may be exploited for control and design. (30 References).},

In particular, we leverage the mathematical properties of cyclic pursuit along with results from contraction and partial contraction theory to design distributed control algorithms ensuring global convergence to symmetric formations. As a base case we consider regular polygons as desired formations and then provide extensions to Johnson solid formations. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the control algorithms under bounded additive disturbances and provide performance bounds with respect to the formation error.},

This paper extends the concept from bipedal to quadrupedal locomotion. A simple rimless-wheel model is analyzed first to provide a few basic insights, followed by a more complex model with freely-swinging legs. The gaits found for the quadruped are similar to, but more efficient than, those of the biped. However, for any reasonable choice of physical parameters for the system, quadrupedal walking is unstable. (7 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are multiple vehicles and multiple priority classes of service demands. Service demands of each priority class arrive in the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site service that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class and that demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its performance under heavy-load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy performs within a constant factor of the lower bound, where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service times, and the convex combination coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study a variation of the Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem (DTRP) in which there are two classes of demands; high priority, and low priority. In the problem, demands arrive in the environment randomly over time and assume a random location and on-site service requirement. A service vehicle must travel to each demand location and provide the required on-site service. The quality of service provided to each class of demands is measured by the expected delay between a demand¿s arrival and its service completion. The goal is to design policies for the service vehicle which minimize a convex combination of the delays for each class. We provide a lower bound on the achievable delay for this problem, and propose a policy which performs within a known constant factor of the optimal in heavy load (i.e., when the fraction of time the service vehicle spends performing on-site service approaches one). The problem studied in this paper is analogous to the multi-class queuing problem in classical queuing theory.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. In our system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is transported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, so that customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to "rebalance the rebalancers" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a customer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route the rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness of the number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can find the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs. Leveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need between 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.},

For bilinear systems, a complete characterization is provided of the weaker property. An interesting fact about functions of type KL is proved as well.},

Once such loops are available, it is possible to employ standard Newton or steepest descent methods, as classically done in numerical control. The theoretical justification of the approach relies on recent results establishing the genericity of nonsingular control, as well as a simple convergence lemma.},

Specifically, we address the difficulties encountered when trajectories are required to preserve the connectedness of the network. The analysis utilizes a quantity called the connectivity robustness of the network, which can be calculated in a distributed fashion, and thus is applicable to distributed motion planning problems arising in control of vehicle networks. Further, these results show that network constraints posed as connectivity robustness constraints have minimal impact on reachability, provided that an appropriate topology control algorithm is implemented. This contrasts with more naive approaches to connectivity maintenance, which can significantly reduce the reachable set.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to provide analytical guidelines and financial justification for the design of shared-vehicle mobility-on-demand systems. Specifically, we consider the fundamental issue of determining the appropriate number of vehicles to field in the fleet, and estimate the financial benefits of several models of car sharing. As a case study, we consider replacing all modes of personal transportation in a city such as Singapore with a fleet of shared automated vehicles, able to drive themselves, e.g., to move to a customer�s location. Using actual transportation data, our analysis suggests a shared-vehicle mobility solution can meet the personal mobility needs of the entire population with a fleet whose size is approximately 1/3 of the total number of passenger vehicles currently in operation.},

  Abstract                 = {In early 2011, NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist released a set of technology roadmaps with the aim of fostering the development of concepts and cross-cutting technologies addressing NASA's needs for the 2011-2021 decade and beyond. NASA reached out to the National Research Council (NRC) to review the program objectives and prioritize the list of technologies. In January 2012, the NRC released its report entitled ``Restoring NASA's Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space." While the NRC report provides a systematic and thorough ranking of the future technology needs for NASA, it does not discuss in detail the technical aspects of its prioritized technologies (which lie beyond its scope). This chapter, building upon this framework, aims at providing such technical details for a selected number of high-priority technologies in the autonomous systems area. Specifically, this chapter focuses on technology area TA04 ``Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems" and discusses in some detail the technical aspects and challenges associated with three high-priority TA04 technologies: ``Relative Guidance Algorithms," ``Extreme Terrain Mobility," and ``Small Body/Microgravity Mobility." Each of these technologies is discussed along four main dimensions: scope, need, state-of-the-art, and challenges/future directions. The result is a unified presentation of key autonomy challenges for next-generation space missions.},

Specifically, the scenario we consider is an in-plane rendezvous of a chaser spacecraft in proximity to a target spacecraft at the origin of the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill frame. The trajectory for the chaser spacecraft is generated in a receding-horizon fashion by executing a sampling-based robotic motion planning algorithm named Fast Marching Trees (FMT*), which efficiently grows a tree of trajectories over a set of probabilistically-drawn samples in the state space. To enforce safety, the tree is only grown over actively safe samples, from which there exists a one-burn collision avoidance maneuver that circularizes the spacecraft orbit along a collision-free coasting arc and that can be executed under potential thruster failures. The overall approach establishes a provably-correct framework for the systematic encoding of safety specifications into the spacecraft trajectory generation process and appears promising for real-time implementation on orbit. Simulation results are presented for a two-fault tolerant spacecraft during autonomous approach to a single client in Low Earth Orbit.},

  Abstract                 = {Bi-directional search is a widely used strategy to increase the success and convergence rates of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Yet, few results are available that merge both bi-directional search and asymptotic optimality into existing optimal planners, such as PRM*, RRT*, and FMT*. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bidirectional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT* performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.},

Most work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner. (14 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Command of support robots by the warfighter requires intuitive interfaces to quickly communicate high degree-of-freedom (DOF) information while leaving the hands unencumbered. Stealth operations rule out voice commands and vision-based gesture interpretation techniques, as they often entail silent operations at night or in other low visibility conditions. Targeted at using bio-signal inputs to set navigation and manipulation goals for the robot (say, simply by pointing), we developed a system based on an electromyography (EMG) "BioSleeve", a high density sensor array for robust, practical signal collection from forearm muscles. The EMG sensor array data is fused with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This paper describes the BioSleeve system and presents initial results of decoding robot commands from the EMG and IMU data using a BioSleeve prototype with up to sixteen bipolar surface EMG sensors. The BioSleeve is demonstrated on the recognition of static hand positions (e.g. palm facing front, fingers upwards) and on dynamic gestures (e.g. hand wave). In preliminary experiments, over 90\% correct recognition was achieved on five static and nine dynamic gestures. We use the BioSleeve to control a team of five LANdroid robots in individual and group/squad behaviors. We define a gesture composition mechanism that allows the specification of complex robot behaviors with only a small vocabulary of gestures/commands, and we illustrate it with a set of complex orders.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, underwater acoustic (UWA) communications have received much attention as their applications are beginning to shift from military towards commercial. UWA communications are made difficult by the combined effect of multipath propagation and high temporal and spatial variability of the channel conditions. Until recently, the design of communication systems has mostly relied on the use of noncoherent modulation techniques. However, to achieve high data rates on the severely bandlimited UWA channels, bandwidth-efficient modulation techniques must be considered, together with array processing for exploitation of spatial multipath diversity. The new generation of underwater communication systems employing phase-coherent modulation techniques will achieve at least a ten fold increase in data throughput. The communication scenario in which the modern UWA systems will operate is that of an underwater network consisting of stationary and mobile nodes. Current research focuses on the development of efficient signal processing algorithms, multiuser communications in the presence of interference, and design of efficient modulation and coding schemes},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of searching for a mobile robber in a simple polygon by a number of searchlights is considered. A searchlight is a stationary point whhich emits a single ray that cannot penetrate the boundary of the polygon. The direction of the ray can be changed continuously, and a point is detected by a searchlight at a given time if and only if it is on the ray. A robber is a point that can move continuously with unbounded speed. First, it is shown that the problem of obtaining a search schedule for an instance having at least one searchlight on the polygon boundary can be reduced to that for instances having no searchlight on the polygon boundary. The reduction is achieved by a recursive search strategy called the one-way sweep strategy. Then various sufficient conditions for the existence of a search schedule are presented by using the concept of a searchlight visibility graph. Finally, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a search schedule for instances having exactly two searchlights in the interior is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient algorithms for collision-free energy sub-optimal path planning for formations of spacecraft flying in deep space are presented. The idea is to introduce a set of way-points through which the spacecraft are required to pass, combined with parameterizations of the trajectories which are energy-optimal for each spacecraft. The resulting constrained optimization problem is formulated as a quasi-quadratic parameter optimization problem in terms of the way-points parameters. The mathematical structure of the problem is further exploited to develop gradient-based algorithms in which the gradients are computed analytically. The collision avoidance constraints are approximated such that closed form solutions are generated. This combination results in fast and robust numerical algorithms which work very well for scenarios involving a large number of spacecraft (e.g. 20).},

  Abstract                 = {Safely integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into civil airspace is contingent upon development of a trustworthy collision avoidance system. This paper proposes an approach whereby a parameterized resolution logic that is considered \emph{trusted} for a given range of its parameters is adaptively tuned online. Specifically, to address the potential conservatism of the resolution logic with static parameters, we present a dynamic programming approach for adapting the parameters dynamically based on the encounter state. We compute the adaptation policy offline using simulation-based approximate dynamic programming which can handle the high dimensionality of the problem. Numerical experiments show that this approach improves safety and operational performance compared to the baseline resolution logic, while retaining trustworthiness.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a system of multiple mobile robots in which each robot, at infinitely many unpredictable time instants, observes the positions of all the robots and moves to a new position determined by the given algorithm. The robots are anonymous in the sense that they all execute the same algorithm and they cannot be distinguished by their appearances. Initially they do not have a common x-y coordinate system. Such a system can be viewed as a distributed system of anonymous mobile processes in which the processes (i.e., robots) can "communicate" with each other only by means of their moves. In this paper we investigate a number of formation problems of geometric patterns in the plane by the robots. Specifically, we present algorithms for converging the robots to a single point and moving the robots to a single point in finite steps. We also characterize the class of geometric patterns that the robots can form in terms of their initial configuration. Some impossibility results are also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {An important aspect of an automated highway system is automatic vehicle following. Automatic vehicle follower systems must address the problem of string stability, i.e., the problem of spacing error propagation, and in some cases, amplification upstream from one vehicle to another due to same disturbance at the head of the platoon. An automatic vehicle following controller design that is (asymptotically) stable for one vehicle following another is not necessarily (asymptotically) stable for a string of vehicles. The dynamic coupling between vehicles in such close-formation platoons is a function of the available information (communicated as well as sensed), decentralized feedback control laws and the vehicle spacing policy in use. In the first half of the paper we develop a framework for establishing conditions for stability of the string in the presence of such dynamic interactions. We then develop a metric for analyzing the performance of a platoon resulting from different vehicle following control algorithms. This metric is the guaranteed rate of attenuation/non-amplification of spacing errors from one vehicle to another. In the latter half of the paper, we outline and analyze various constant spacing vehicle follower algorithms. All these algorithms are analyzed for sensing/actuation lags. (34 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Introduces the notion of string stability of a countably infinite interconnection of a class of nonlinear systems. Intuitively, string stability implies uniform boundedness of all the states of the interconnected system for all time if the initial states of the interconnected system are uniformly bounded. It is well known that the input output gain of all the subsystems less than unity guarantees that the interconnected system is input-output stable. The authors derive sufficient ("weak coupling") conditions which guarantee the asymptotic string stability of a class of interconnected systems. Under the same "weak coupling" conditions, string-stable interconnected systems remain string stable in the presence of small structural/singular perturbations. In the presence of parameter mismatch, these "weak coupling" conditions ensure that the states of all the subsystems are all uniformly bounded when a gradient-based parameter adaptation law is used and that the states of all the systems go to zero asymptotically.

The design of a spherical coordinates quantizer in k dimensions with k[right angle bracket]2 (k=2 matches published results) is considered.

  Abstract                 = {A new approach to the dynamic control of manipulators is developed from the viewpoint of mechanics. It is first shown that a linear feedback of generalized coordinates and their derivatives are effective for motion control in the large. Next, a method is proposed for task-oriented coordinate control which can be easily implemented by a microcomputer and is suited to sensor feedback control. The proposed method is applicable even when holonomic constraints are added to the system. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulation. (12 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In the surveillance of multiple targets by mobile sensor agents (MSAs), system performance relies greatly on the motion-control strategy of the MSAs. This paper investigates the motion-planning problem for a limited resource of M MSAs in an environment of N targets (M<N). The kinematics of the MSA is modeled as a point mass moving at a constant speed with a bounded turning radius. Based on the fact that the track information of each target degrades over time, the motion-planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the average time duration between two consecutive observations of each target. In the case of a single MSA, the motion-planning problem is further interpreted so as to find a time-optimal loop path to traverse the targets. A gradient-approximation algorithm is then proposed to generate a suboptimal loop path for a mobile agent to traverse a sequence of target points. For the multi-MSA-multitarget case, a cooperative online motion-planning approach is developed.},

We introduce a class of local control laws for a group of mobile agents that result in: (i) global alignment of their velocity vectors, (ii) convergence of their speeds to a common one, (iii) collision avoidance, and (iv) minimization of the agents arti cial potential energy. These are made possible through local control action by exploiting the algebraic graph theoretic properties of the underlying interconnection graph. Algebraic connectivity affects the performance and robustness properties of the overall closed loop system.We show how the stability of the ocking motion of the group is directly associated with the connectivity properties of the interconnection network and is robust to arbitrary switching of the network topology.},

  Abstract                 = {We prove a generalized Lyapunov theorem which guarantees practical asymptotic stability. Based on this theorem, we show that if the averaged system x=f/sub av/(x) corresponding to x=f(x, t) is globally asymptotically stable then, starting from an arbitrarily large set of initial conditions, the trajectories of x=f(x, t/ epsilon ) converge uniformly to an arbitrarily small residual set around the origin when epsilon >0 is taken sufficiently small. In other words, the origin is semi-globally, practically, asymptotically stable. (10 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We propose and investigate new probabilistic models for linear programming. In contrast to previous models, ours guarantee the existence of optimal solutions and are symmetric under duality. While in some respects our distributions are very special, there is sufficient flexibility to permit an arbitrary degree of primal and/or dual degeneracy, either just at the optimal solution or throughout the feasible region using null variables. Moreover, the precision of the distributions allows us to compute the probability that the feasible region is bounded as well as the distribution of the distance to a constraint hyperplane and that of the components of a vertex. Interest in these measures stems from Karmarkar's algorithm, and we also introduce a model for generating random linear programming problems on a simplex.},

The safe resolution of trajectory conflicts between aircraft is necessary to the success of such a distributed control system. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize provably safe conflict resolution manoeuvres. The method models the aircraft and the manoeuvre as a hybrid control system and calculates the maximal set of safe initial conditions for each aircraft so that separation is assured in the presence of uncertainties in the actions of the other aircraft. Examples of manoeuvres using both speed and heading changes are worked out in detail. (46 References).},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis presents new techniques for planning and robustly controlling the motion of nonlinear underactuated vehicles when disturbances are present and only imperfect state measurements are available for feedback. The basic motion planning algorithm uses cubic splines or Pythagorean hodograph curves to connect the initial and final configurations and to generate a feasible trajectory for the system. The feasible trajectory and its control inputs are improved through an iterative \hinf -filter. Techniques are demonstrated for generalizing the motion planning algorithm to address the obstacle avoidance, multiple vehicle, and minimum distance planning problems. To track a desired trajectory, first a state feedback control law is developed for the linearized system using an \hinf -optimal design. The state feedback controller produces a locally exponentially stable closed-loop system and guarantees a precomputable level of disturbance attenuation for the system. Subsequently, an imperfect state measurement feedback controller is developed by combining a state estimate with the state feedback control law. The state estimator exploits a unique structure in the nonlinear equations of motion to decompose the system into two interlaced subsystems, which leads to a direct solution. The estimator is actually an \hinf -filter, and under it the controller achieves a modified form of disturbance attenuation. Simulations included in the thesis illustrate the motion planning, the state feedback control and the imperfect state measurement control algorithms derived, for selected models of nonlinear underactuated vehicles. ensuremath{ mathrm{H} {infty}}},

  Abstract                 = {Pickup and delivery problems (PDPs), in which objects or people have to be transported between specific locations, are among the most common combinatorial problems in real-world logistical operations. A widely-encountered type of PDP is the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP), where each commodity/customer is associated with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour visiting all locations with the constraint that each pickup location and its associated delivery location are visited in immediate, consecutive order. The SCP is NP-Hard and the best known approximation algorithm only provides a 9/5 approximation ratio. In this paper, we examine an embedding of the SCP within a stochastic framework, and our objective is three-fold: First, we describe a large class of algorithms for the SCP, where every member is asymptotically optimal, i.e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; moreover, one can achieve computational complexity $O(n^2+\epsilon)$ within the class, where n is the number of pickup/delivery pairs and $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Second, we characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour asymptotically. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the SCP, whereby pickup and delivery requests arrive according to a Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale demand-responsive transport (DRT) systems. For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and the number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the Euclidean Bipartite Matching Problem and the theory of random permutations, and, for the dynamic setting, exhibit novel features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Demand-responsive transport (DRT) systems, where users generate requests for transportation from a pickup point to a delivery point, are expected to increase in usage dramatically as the inconvenience of privately-owned cars in metropolitan areas becomes excessive. However, despite the increasing role of DRT systems, there are very few rigorous results characterizing achievable performance (in terms, e.g., of stability conditions). In this paper, our aim is to bridge this gap for a rather general model of DRT systems, which takes the form of a generalized Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem. The key strategy is to develop analytical bounds for the optimal cost of the Euclidean Stacker Crane Problem (ESCP), which represents a general static model for DRT systems. By leveraging such bounds, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of DRT systems; the condition depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic distributions of pickup and delivery points, customers' arrival rate, and the number of vehicles. Our results exhibit some surprising features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most common combinatorial problems in logistics and transportation-after the Traveling Salesman Problem-is the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP), where commodities or customers are associated each with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour `picking up' and `delivering' all items, while ensuring the number of items on-board never exceeds a given capacity. While vastly many SCPs encountered in practice are embedded in road or road-like networks, very few studies explicitly consider such environments. In this paper, first, we formulate an environment model capturing the essential features of a �small-neighborhood� road network, along with models for omni-directional vehicles and directed vehicles. Then, we formulate a stochastic version of the unit-capacity SCP, on our road network model, where pickup/delivery sites are random points along segments of the network. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem that is asymptotically constant-factor; i.e., it produces a solution no worse than $\kappa+o(1)$ times the length of the optimal one, where $o(1)$ goes to zero as the number of items grows large, almost surely. The constant $\kappa$ is at most 3, and for omni-directional vehicles it is provably 1, i.e., optimal. Simulations show that with a number of pickup/delivery pairs as low as 50, the proposed algorithm delivers a solution whose cost is consistently within 10\% of that of an optimal solution.},

  Abstract                 = {We present serial and parallel algorithms for solving a system of equations that arises from the discretization of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated to a trajectory optimization problem of the following type. A vehicle starts at a prespecified point x/sub o/ and follows a unit speed trajectory x(t) inside a region in R/sup m/ until an unspecified time T that the region is exited. A trajectory minimizing a cost function of the form integral /sub 0//sup T/ r(x(t))dt+q(x(T)) is sought. The discretized Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to this problem is usually solved using iterative methods. Nevertheless, assuming that the function r is positive, we are able to exploit the problem structure and develop one-pass algorithms for the discretized problem. The first algorithm resembles Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and runs in time O(n log n), where n is the number of grid points. The second algorithm uses a somewhat different discretization and borrows some ideas from a variation of Dial's shortest path algorithm (1969) that we develop here; it runs in time O(n), which is the best possible, under some fairly mild assumptions. Finally, we show that the latter algorithm can be efficiently parallelized: for two-dimensional problems and with p processors, its running time becomes O(n/p), provided that p=O( square root n/log n).},

A model for asynchronous distributed computation is presented and then the convergence of natural asynchronous distributed versions of a large class of deterministic and stochastic gradient-like algorithms is analyzed. It is shown that such algorithms retain the desirable convergence properties of their centralized counterparts, provided that the time between consecutive communications between processors and communication delays is not too large.

  Abstract                 = {As robots and other autonomous agents become more widespread, there will be a greater need for them to work cooperatively to accomplish complex, that is, agents will enter or leave the system while the task is being performed. This presents a formidable problem for organizing and controlling the agents. We present an approach to this problem for autonomous oceanographic sampling networks, which are groups of robots and sensor platforms that cooperate to sample an area over a long period of time. The approach uses two organizations to control the agents. A task-level organization (TLO) controls the system during the actual mission, and a meta-level organization (MLO) is responsible for self-organization of the system, design of the TLO to fit the situation, and reorganization as necessary. This approach allows the TLO to be highly efficient, while allowing the MLO to give the overall system a great deal of flexibility in adapting to change. (14 References).},

Based on a scalar measure of performance defined on the corresponding Fisher information matrix, two approaches are developed for this problem: introduction of continuous designs, which allows for adaptation of well-known sequential algorithms of classical optimum experimental design, and application of standard nonlinear programming techniques. In each case, particular algorithms are delineated and analysis of the appropriate sensor placements is made. The relative advantages and shortcomings of both the approaches are discussed and demonstrated by applying them to a two-dimensional diffusion process. (45 References).},

The global design criterion is the Frobenius condition number for the Hessian of the least-squares criterion. The approach converts the problem to an optimal control one in which both the control forces of the sensors and the initial sensor positions are optimized. Its solution is obtained by the use of a gradient algorithm which handles various constraints imposed on sensor motions. Among other things, the method copes efficiently with problems involving state constraints induced by collision-avoidance conditions or admissible distances between the sensors. A simple test problem is presented to illustrate the presented ideas. (17 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we review a recently developed class of algorithms that solve global problems in unit distance wireless networks by means of local algorithms. A local algorithm is one in which any node of a network only has information on nodes at distance at most k from itself, for a constant k. For example, given a unit distance wireless network N, we want to obtain a planar subnetwork of N by means of an algorithm in which all nodes can communicate only with their neighbors in N, perform some operations, and then halt. We review algorithms for obtaining planar subnetworks, approximations to minimum weight spanning trees, Delaunay triangulations, and relative neighbor graphs. Given a unit distance wireless network N, we present new local algorithms to solve the following problems: 1. Calculate small dominating sets (not necessarily connected) of N. 2. Extract a bounded degree planar subgraph H of N and obtain a proper edge coloring of H with at most 12 colors. The second of these algorithms can be used in the channel assignment problem.},

However, the performance of these systems could be severely degraded by dynamic disturbances to the spacecraft caused by manipulator motions.

This representation is then applied to develop algorithms which can be used to plan manipulator motions that minimize disturbances of the spacecraft. (25 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Future robotic manipulator systems will be required to perform complex tasks in space such as satellite repair. These robotic manipulators will encounter a number of kinematic, dynamic, and control problems caused by the dynamic coupling between the manipulators and its spacecraft. This dynamic coupling also makes it difficult to analyze these systems. The paper introduces a new analytical modeling method for space manipulators called the virtual manipulator (VM), which has a fixed base in inertial space at a point called a virtual ground. The kinematics and dynamics of the manipulator, spacecraft, and payload can be described relatively easily in terms of the VM. With its fixed base, the virtual manipulator is shown to have the potential to be an effective aid for the analysis, design, and development of future space manipulator systems. (22 References).},

  Abstract                 = {In semidefinite programming, one minimizes a linear function subject to the constraint that an affine combination of symmetric matrices is positive semidefinite. Such a constraint is nonlinear and nonsmooth, but convex, so semidefinite programs are convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming unifies several standard problems (e.g., linear and quadratic programming) and finds many applications in engineering and combinatorial optimization. Although semidefinite programs are much more general than linear programs, they are not much harder to solve. Most interior-point methods for linear programming have been generalized to semidefinite programs. As in linear programming, these methods have polynomial worst-case complexity and perform very well in practice. This paper gives a survey of the theory and applications of semidefinite programs and an introduction to primal-dual interior-point methods for their solution. (117 References).},

  Abstract                 = {Geometric representations of the environment play an important role in mobile robotics as they support various tasks such as motion control and accurate localization. Popular approaches to represent the geometric features of an environment are occupancy grids or line models. Whereas occupancy grids require a huge amount of memory and therefore do not scale well with the size of the environment, line models are unable to correctly represent corners or connections between objects. In this paper we present an algorithm that learns sets of polylines from laser range scans. Starting with an initial set of polylines generated from the range scans it iteratively optimizes these polylines using the Bayesian Information Criterion. During the optimization process our algorithm utilizes information about the angles between line segments extracted from the original range scans. We present experiments illustrating that our algorithm is able to learn accurate and highly compact polyline maps from laser range data obtained with mobile robots.},

  Abstract                 = {A decentralized sequential detection problem is considered where a set of sensors making independent observations must decide which of the given two hypotheses is true. Decision errors are penalized through a common cost function, and each time step taken by the sensors as a team is assigned a positive cost. It is shown that optimal sensor decision functions can be found in the class of generalized sequential probability ratio tests (GSPRTs) with monotonically convergent thresholds. A technique is presented for obtaining the optimal thresholds. The performance of the optimal policy is compared with that of a policy which uses SPRTs at each of the sensors.},

In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation ( eta ) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, |va| = 0) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. The transition is continuous, since |va| is found to scale as ( eta c- eta ) beta with beta ~=0.45.},

Some specific problems that fall within this framework include: robust stabilization of a family of plants by a fixed controller belonging to a specified family of controllers, and the minimization of weighted H/sub 2//H/sub infinity /-norms.},

Some of the elements of statistical learning theory, which forms the basis of the randomized approach, are briefly described. Finally, these two sets of ideas are brought together to show that it is possible to construct efficient randomized algorithms for each of the difficult problems discussed by using the ideas of statistical learning theory. A real-life design example of synthesizing a first-order controller for the longitudinal stabilization of an unstable fighter aircraft is then presented to show that the randomized approach can be quite successful in tackling a practical problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Two methods are described for exploring a continuous unknown planar region by a group of robots having limited sensors and no explicit communication. We formalize the problem and show a lower bound on the length of any solution. A deterministic "mark and cover" (MAC) algorithm is then described to solve the problem using short-lived navigational markers as means of navigation and indirect communication. The convergence of the algorithm is proved, and its cover time is shown to be the asymptotically optimal O(A/a), A being the total area and a - the area covered by the robot in a single step. The MAC algorithm is tested against an alternative randomized "probabilistic covering" (PC) method, which does not rely on sensors but is still able to cover an unknown region in an expected time that depends polynomially on the dimensions of the region. Both algorithms enable cooperation of several robots to achieve faster covergae. Finally we show that the two methods can be combined to yield a third, hybrid algorithm with a better tradeoff between performance and robustness.},

Assignments are based on multi-target tours that consider the spread of the targets and the sensor capabilities of the vehicles. In this way, the individual agents and the team as a whole make better use of team resources and improve team cooperation. Planning and assignments are accomplished in reasonable computational time through the use of heuristics to reduce the problem size.},

  Abstract                 = {Designing an experiment for parameter estimation involves two steps. The first one is qualitative, and consists of selecting a suitable configuration of the input/output ports so as to make, if possible, all the parameters of interest identifiable. The second step is quantitative, and based on the optimization of a suitable criterion (with respect to the input shapes, sampling schedule, . . .) so as to get the maximum information from the data to be collected. When the model is nonlinear in the parameters, the typical situation for phenomenological models, both steps present specific difficulties which are discussed in the paper. The practical importance of qualitative experiment design is illustrated by a very simple biological model. Various policies presented in the literature for quantitative experiment design are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to methods allowing uncertainty on the prior information to be taken into account. (194 References).},

  Abstract                 = {A technique for coordinating the paths of multiple robots in the presence of obstacles is presented. To accomplish this, the robots are prioritized. A path that avoids only the stationary obstacles is planned for the highest-priority robot. A trajectory for the next-lowest priority robot is planned so that it avoids both the stationary obstacles and the higher-priority robot, which is treated as a moving obstacle. This process is continued until trajectories for all of the robots have been planned. The planning is accomplished by first mapping the real space of the robots into configuration-space-time. Potential fields are applied around the c-space-time obstacles and are used to modify the path of the robot. The advantage of using artificial potential fields is that they offer a relatively fast and efficient way to solve for safe trajectories around both stationary and moving obstacles. In the method used to perform path planning, a trial path through the c-span-time is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential fields until an appropriate path is found.

  Abstract                 = {A novel 3-D ultrasound position sensor provides low-cost, high-precision measurements of the Cartesian position of a robot wrist within a the robot's workspace. These measurements can, for instance, be used in a taskspace feedback loop to reduce the kinematic error. The basic idea is to mount ultrasound senders on the manipulator wrist and compute the 3-D Cartesian position of these sensors using 1-D range measurements between the senders and an array of ultrasound receivers at fixed, known locations. The main obstacle to precise range measurements is the presence of air turbulences and convection currents. This gives rise to noise which is spatially and temporally correlated. A stochastic model of this noise is presented and backed by experiments. It is proposed that the changing 3-D Cartesian position of the moving wrist is tracked by the sensor using a modified extended Kalman filter which incorporates the stochastic noise model and information derived from a static reference sender.},

  Abstract                 = {Presents results on the behaviour of an n-link pendulum which is controlled by means of an oscillatory input forcing one end link. We adopt the averaged potential as the primary tool in our equilibrium and stability analysis. While such control of single-degree-of-freedom systems has been studied in fair detail by Weibel and Baillieul (1997, 1998), researchers are only beginning to explore the issues which arise in the control of multi-degree-of-freedom systems. Of specific interest is the behaviour when the system possesses bifurcations and more than one stable equilibrium. We present a study of the bifurcations and stability of a periodically forced cart and n-pendulum on an inclined plane. Periodic open-loop forcing of the single degree-of-freedom pendulum has previously been shown to be a robust and effective means of stabilizing the inverted equilibrium, and this robustness carries over to the multi-degree-of-freedom case provided attention is paid to matching the forcing amplitude to the characteristic length scales of the system. In addition, we present numerical results on the basins of attraction of the vertically forced double pendulum. We present an exact model for the n-degree-of-freedom system, non-dimensionalize the model, and compute the averaged potential. Equilibria and their stability characteristics are found through a bifurcation analysis of the averaged potential. For a double pendulum system, we are able to provide a detailed comparison of analytical, numerical and experimental results-all of which are found to be in close agreement.},

  Abstract                 = {A new class of exponentially stabilizing control laws for joint level control of robot arms is introduced. It has recently been recognized that the non-linear dynamics associated with robotic manipulators have certain inherent passivity properties. More specifically, the derivation of the robotic dynamic equations from Hamilton's principle gives rise to natural Lyapunov functions for control design based on total energy considerations. Through a slight modification of the energy Lyapunov function and the use of a convenient lemma to handle third-order terms in the Lyapunov function derivatives, closed-loop exponential stability for both the set point and tracking control problem is demonstrated. In one new design, the non-linear terms are decoupled from real-time measurements which completely removes the requirement for on-line computation of non-linear terms in the controller implementation. In general, the new class of control laws offers alternatives to the more conventional computed torque method, providing trade-offs between computation and convergence properties. Furthermore, these control laws have the unique feature that they can be adapted in a very simple fashion to achieve asymptotically stable adaptive control. (21 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We present a vehicle model that includes vehicle dynamics and a vehicle tire model. The model developed is then used for conducting steering analysis of an automated vehicle. We test the developed model on a step lane change manoeuvre and propose a model-reference based controller for remote control of a vehicle. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system using the Lyapunov approach is included.},

  Annote                   = {"CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS AND SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES FOR DISTRIBUTED MOBILE AGENTS (COLLECTIVE ROBOTICS)." In this strand I am interested in building mobile robots that may be used as platforms for conducting research into distributed mobile robotics. This work is concerned therefore with software and communications architectures that might facilitate potentially large populations of mobile agents. The LinuxBot, for instance, integrates a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) embedded PC-compatible controller, wireless LAN technology and the Linux operating system to produce a remarkably capable (in respect of control and communications) wheeled mobile robot. Here is a page describing the LinuxBot. A new smaller version, the uLinuxBot achieves a similar level of functionality in a wheeled platform just 5cm in diameter and 8cm in height. As part of this work I am interested in ad-hoc wireless networking. In other words, how a potentially large population of identical mobile agents each of which has limited wireless range, can dynamically self-organise to maintain overall connectivity (with no fixed infrastructure).},

  Abstract                 = { This paper consists of two parts. The subject of Part I is the following problem.Given are the axis and the angle of a finite rotation about a fixed point.Given are, furthermore, the axes of three consecutive rotations. To be determined are the angles of the three consecutive rotations such that theirresultant rotation is the given rotation. Explicit solutions to this problemare developed. Conditions for the existence of real solutions are given. In certain cases called critical the first and the third angleare not individually determinate. Only their sum or their difference is. Conditionsspecifying critical cases are developed. In Part II of the paper the more general problem of decomposition of a finite screw displacement into three consecutive screw displacements about given screw axes is solved.The solution is achieved by applying the transference principle of Kotelnikov and Study to the solution of the rotation problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Internal rotors may usefully complement more conventional means of underwater vehicle actuation by extending the operating regime and improving reliability. In this paper we describe stabilizing control laws for an underwater vehicle using internal rotors. Our stabilizing control laws consist of two terms: the first term addresses the conservative part of the system by shaping energy to yield Lyapunov stability, while the second term adds dissipation to ensure asymptotic stability to the motion of interest.

  Abstract                 = {A linear, finite-dimensional plant, with state-space parameter dependence, is controlled using a parameter-dependent controller. The parameters whose values are in a compact set, are known in real time. Their rates of variation are bounded and known in real time also. The goal of control is to stabilize the parameter-dependent closed-loop system, and provide disturbance/error attenuation as measured in induced L/sub 2/ norm. Our approach uses a bounding technique based on a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, and then solves the control synthesis problem by reformulating the existence conditions into a semi-infinite dimensional convex optimization. We propose finite dimensional approximations to get sufficient conditions for successful controller design.},

  Abstract                 = {Unlike wired networks, wireless networks do not come with links. Rather, links have to be fashioned out of the ether by nodes choosing neighbors to connect to. Moreover the location of the nodes may be random. The question that we resolve is: How many neighbors should each node be connected to in order that the overall network is connected in a multi-hop fashion? We show that in a network with n randomly placed nodes, each node should be connected to $\Theta(log n)$ nearest neighbors. If each node is connected to less than $0.074 log n$ nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically disconnected with probability one as $n$ increases, while if each node is connected to more than $5.1774 log n$ nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically connected with probability approaching one as $n$ increases. It appears that the critical constant may be close to one, but that remains an open problem. These results should be contrasted with some works in the 1970s and 1980s which suggested that the "magic number" of nearest neighbors should be six or eight.},

This control method is called linear autonomous system (LAS). With LAS, the controllability of group shape can be defined. This is because a decision of a shape of the group corresponds to designing a potential field that is spread on a space of relative distance between mobile robots. Since each mobile robot has parameter for designing the spread potential field, a shape of the group can be adapted to various situations by means of changing the parameters with respect to state of environment, for example, the position of wall, a velocity of an obstacle, etc. Effectiveness of this control method is verified by a computer simulation. It means that a mobile robot is captured by a group that consists of multiple mobile robots. (10 References).},

The existence of an optimal path class satisfying the UAV kinematic constraints and vector calculus are exploited to reduce this class of optimal path-planning problems to a parameter optimization problem. Illustrative tactical constraints arising in target touring and obstacle avoidance problems are considered. A necessary condition for optimal path planning in the presence of tactical constraints is characterized.. An efficient numerical algorithm using simulated dynamics is developed to enforce the optimality criterion. The proposed optimal path planner can handle multiple tactical constraints. An illustrative numerical simulation demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A system of launchable miniature mobile robots with various sensors as payload is used for distributed sensing. The robots are projected to areas of interest either by a robot launcher or by a human operator using standard equipment. A wireless communication network is used to exchange information with the robots. Payloads such as a MEMS sensor for vibration detection, a microphone and an active video module are used mainly to detect humans. The video camera provides live images through a wireless video transmitter and a pan-tilt mechanism expands the effective field of view. There are strict restrictions on total volume and power consumption of the payloads due to the small size of the robot. Emerging technologies are used to address these restrictions. We describe the use of microrobotic technologies to develop active vision modules for the mesoscale robot. A single chip CMOS video sensor is used along with a miniature lens that is approximately the size of a sugar cube. The device consumes 100 mW; about 5 times less than the power consumption of a comparable CCD camera. Miniature gearmotors 3 mm in diameter are used to drive the pan-tilt mechanism. A miniature video transmitter is used to transmit analog video signals from the camera. (15 References).},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the Fer and the Magnus expansions for the numerical solution of the nonlinear matrix Lie-group ODE y'= gamma (t,y)y, y(0)=y/sub 0/, where y evolves in a matrix Lie group G and gamma (t,y) is in the Lie algebra g. Departing from a geometrical approach that distinguishes between those operations performed in the group and those performed in the tangent space, we construct Lie-group invariant methods based on collocation. We prove that, as long as the two expansions are correctly truncated, the collocation nodes c/sub 1/, c/sub 2/, ..., c/sub nu / yield numerical methods whose order is the same as in the classical setting. We also relax the collocation conditions, thereby devising explicit methods of order 3. To conclude, we discuss the proposed methods in a numerical experiment that arises in Hamiltonian mechanics, comparing the results with projection techniques. (35 References).},

  Abstract                 = {The assignment problem constitutes one of the fundamental problems in the context of linear programming. Besides its theoretical significance, its frequent appearance in the areas of distributed control and facility allocation, where the problems\~{A}'\^{A} size and the cost for global computation and information can be highly prohibitive, gives rise to the need for local solutions that dynamically assign distinct agents to distinct tasks, while maximizing the total assignment benefit. In this paper, we consider the linear assignment problem in the context of networked systems, where the main challenge is dealing with the lack of global information due to the limited communication capabilities of the agents. We address this challenge by means of a distributed auction algorithm, where the agents are able to bid for the task to which they wish to be assigned. The desired assignment relies on an appropriate selection of bids that determine the prices of the tasks and render them more or less attractive for the agents to bid for. Up to date pricing information, necessary for accurate bidding, can be obtained in a multi-hop fashion by means of local communication between adjacent agents. Our algorithm is an extension to the parallel auction algorithm proposed by Bertsekas et al to the case where only local information is available and it is shown to always converge to an assignment that maximizes the total assignment benefit within a linear approximation of the optimal one.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present and analyze a queueing-theoretical model for autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems where robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the entire network. We cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles and keeping vehicles availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City. The case study shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 60\% of the size of the current taxi fleet). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and we study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.},

  Abstract                 = {This tutorial paper examines the operational and economic aspects of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems, a rapidly emerging mode of personal transportation wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers in a given environment. We address AMoD systems along three dimensions: (1) modeling - analytical models capable of capturing the salient dynamic and stochastic features of customer demand, (2) control - coordination algorithms for the vehicles aimed at stability and subsequently throughput maximization, and (3) economic - fleet sizing and financial analyses for case studies of New York City and Singapore. Collectively, the models and algorithms presented in this paper enable a rigorous assessment of the value of AMoD systems. In particular, the case study of New York City shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70\% of the size of the current taxi fleet), while the case study of Singapore suggests that an AMoD system can meet the personal mobility need of the entire population of Singapore with a number of robotic vehicles that is less than 40\% of the current number of passenger vehicles. Directions for future research on AMoD systems are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The emerging area of control with limited data rates incorporates ideas from both control and information theory. The data rate constraint introduces quantization into the feedback loop and gives the interconnected system a two-fold nature, continuous and symbolic. In this paper, we review the results available in the literature on data-rate-limited control. For linear systems, we show how fundamental trade-offs between the data rate and control goals, such as stability, mean entry times, and asymptotic state norms, emerge naturally. While many classical tools from both control and information theory can still be used in this context, it turns out that the deepest results necessitate a novel, integrated view of both disciplines.},
