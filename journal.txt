Alright - time to start this

Here are the tasks:

[ ] UAV chapter
    [ ] Resurrect Code
    [ ] Switch to constrained action space
[ ] POMCPOW Chapter
    [ ] Show experimentally that DESPOT converges to QMDP
        [ ] 2D Light-Dark with discrete actions
        [ ] 1D Light-Dark with discrete actions
    [ ] Problem where POMCPOW can beat discretized DESPOT
        [ ] Tricky Lasertag
        [ ] Car
    [ ] Proof
        [ ] Contact chinese guy
[ ] Lane-changing chapter
    [ ] Something with information gathering?
    [ ] Use POMCPOW? (Probably not important)

Missing piece: real-world driving problem where info-gathering matters
