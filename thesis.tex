% basically this is a template file, you should be able to take it and
% start running.

% the philosophy behind this template is that each chapter or
% chapterlike section goes in a separate file and you use the \include
% command to input it into the final document.  The \includeonly
% command can be used so you only need to work on one or two chapters at a
% time (instead of having to either latex the entire book each time or
% losing cross-references and page numbering)

% copy this file and call it something like mythesis.tex

\documentclass[12pt]{report}
% note that the documentclass can take other option such as
% twoside - for double sided printing
% openright - if double side  chapters always start on odd pages
% openany - if double side chapters start on the next page even or odd
% 12pt can be replaced by 11pt

\usepackage{suthesis-2e}
% options are
% online - now the default
% hardcopy - turns off online includes signature page and copyright page in file 
% engineer - does an engineer thesis instead of a PhD dissertation

%% load other packages you need

%% uncomment the following and create mythesis-macros.sty for all your
%% own macros.  This keeps this top level file looking fairly neat.
% \usepackage{mythesis-macros}

%% certain types of theses require special title page format.  See the
%% style file for the full list.  An example would be that for some of
%% the language departments. 
% \dualthesis \dept{Asian Languages} \languagemajor{Korean} 
%% or education
% \educationthesis

    \title{Safety and Efficiency in Autonomous Vehicles through Planning with Uncertainty}
    \author{Zachary Nolan Sunberg}
    \dept{Aeronautics and Astronautics} % default is Computer Science, uncomment for other departments
    \principaladviser{Mykel J. Kochenderfer}
% \coprincipaladvisor{}
    \firstreader{Marco Pavone}
    \secondreader{Mac Schwager}
% \thirdreader{}

%the following command would (if uncommented) allow  only chapter1 and
%chapter2 to be processed
%\includeonly{chapter1,chapter2}

% if you feel real savvy use
% \typein{Now put in includeonly}
% the \typein command stops latex at this point and allows you to type
% in a command such as
% \includeonly{chapter3,chapter5}
% this can save some time and means you don't have to edit this file

\prefacesection{Abstract}

One way that artificial intelligence will transform the human experience is by enabling machines to become autonomous.
Vehicles with limited autonomy are already being used for transportation, monitoring, and agricultural applications, and will likely become ubiquitous in the future.
Since they will interact closely with human beings, an effective autonomous vehicle or robot must maintain safety while acting efficiently in terms of time, energy, and other resources.
Unfortunately, the objectives of safety and efficiency are fundamentally opposed because safety constraints prohibit some efficient actions.

Interaction between safety and efficiency is made more difficult by the presence of uncertainty.
Uncertainty is prevalent in every domain that robots operate in.
Specifically, there are three different types of uncertainty that autonomous systems deal with.
First, there is outcome uncertainty, which is inherent uncertainty about how the state of the world changes through time.
Second, since sensors can only gain a limited amount of information about the world, there is state uncertainty.
Third, there is uncertainty in the dynamics model that an autonomous system uses to plan.

Correctly modelling uncertainty is very important for optimizing efficiency while maintaining safety.
A model that contains too much uncertainty will result in over-conservative behavior because the autonomous agent cannot eliminate the possibility that safety constraints will be violated.
On the other hand, a model with too little uncertainty may result in dangerous over-confident behavior.
Improving the uncertainty model can result in simultaneous safety and efficiency gains.

This thesis examines how planning with uncertainty using Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) can improve autonomous vehicle performance.
Two chapters contain simulation studies of two applications - collision avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles and lane changing for autonomous cars.
A third chapter shows that leading online POMDP solvers will fail in certain POMDPs that have continuous observation spaces and proposes a new algorithm, POMCPOW, to fix this.
Finally, it presents the POMDPs.jl software interface, a package for the Julia programming language that provides for quick experimentation and comparison of leading algorithms for solving POMDPs with unprecedented ease.


% first the preface sections.  

% this includes the file preface.tex which should include the
% following commands
% \beforepreface
% \prefacesection{preface}
% body of the preface
% \include{preface}

% any other preface sections

% the last preface section (e.g., acknowledgement.tex)
% should look like
% \prefacesection{Acknowledgement}
% body 
% \afterpreface
% \include{acknowledgement}


% now for the body of the thesis, modify the number of these lines as needed

% this includes chapter1.tex which should start with a \chapter{...}
% command 
\include{pomcpow}
% \include{chapter2}
% \include{chapter3}
% \include{chapter4}
% \include{chapter5}

% and the end material

% \appendix
% 
% \include{appendix1}
% \include{appendix2}
% \include{appendix3}


% bibliography.tex should include either 
% \bibliographystyle{...}
% \bibliography{mythesis}
% or some other way of doing the bibliography
% \include{bibliography}
